              The focus of this research is to develop new synthetic methodology in the
              context of complex molecule synthesis.  Projects involving palladium-catalyzed
              oxidative [4+2] cycloaddition reactions and tandem Bamford-Stevens/Claisen
              rearrangements will be carried out and a concise, stereoselective route to the
              hypoglycemogenic diterpenoid, saudin will be developed.  In the educational
              realm, courses on synthesis and pharmaceutical chemistry are being developed
              and outreach activities enabling students to interact with the broader local
              community are in place.

With this CAREER award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational
              efforts of Dr. Brian Stoltz of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical
              Engineering at the California Institute of Technology.  Professor Stoltz will
              focus his research on the development of new synthetic methodology within the
              framework of natural product total synthesis.  The illustrative target
              molecule, saudin, has interesting biological properties of interest to the
              pharmaceutical industry.  The education activities will stress outreach to
              local middle schools and high schools and will also focus on course development
              at the undergraduate and graduate level.
