This is a one-year dissertation enhancement proposal
              submitted by Ms. Julie Callahan, a doctoral candidate in Environmental, Coastal
              and Ocean sciences, University of Massachusetts at Boston and her advisor, Dr.
              Robert Chen.  This project involves collaboration with Professor Minhan Dai,
              Xiamen University, China.  This study will characterize high molecular weight
              dissolved organic matter in the Preal River Estuary.  This project will provide
              an excellent opportunity for comparative studies of two large river systems,
              the Mississippi River plume and the Preal River Estuary and will fill a need
              for information on cycling of dissolved organic materials in these estuaries. 
              This will also provide opportunities for Ms. Callahan to carry out Ph.D.
              research in China, and for her to gain valuable field research experience
              there.  The Natural Science Foundation of China and the NSF jointly support
              this project.
