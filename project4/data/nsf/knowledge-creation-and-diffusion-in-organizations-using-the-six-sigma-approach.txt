                 PIs propose to assess Six Sigma practices as indicators of knowledge
              creation, diffusion and use in complex organizations. In Phase 1, they will
              develop exploratory cases in two firms, capturing a current and retrospective
              project in each. Six different Six Sigma methodologies will be the focus of
              data collected from structured and unstructured interviews, site tours,
              archival sources and questionnaires. In phase 2, theories developed will be
              empirically examined in a larger sample of 200 projects from five other
              companies.
	
   This proposal balances explicit learning and knowledge with
              tacit learning and knowledge, and, via the Six Sigma process, directs attention
              to specific knowledge management practices. Panelists suggested further
              attention to the context of Six Sigma, going beyond this method itself to the
              larger questions of knowledge management, particularly in light of researchers'
              intent to study Motorola, which has reportedly refocused its attention. In
              addition, panelists also suggested a closer look at social network data,
              allowing for a concurrent test of the alternative social factors explanations
              and substantially bolstering the strength of the proposed research.
