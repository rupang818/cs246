              The Gordon Research Conferences, initiated in the late 1920's by Dr. Neil E.
              Gordon, promote discussions and the free exchange of ideas at the research
              frontiers of the biological, chemical and physical sciences.  Scientists with
              common professional interests come together for a full week of intense
              discussion and examination of the most advanced aspects of their field.  These
              Conferences, which are usually held in small isolated New England towns away
              from other distractions, are attended by graduate students, postdoctoral
              fellows, junior investigators and senior scientists, and provide a valuable
              means of disseminating information and ideas.  This award represents full or
              partial support of thirteen conferences in the biological sciences, being held
              in the summer of 2002 through the spring of 2003.
