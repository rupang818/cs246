ABSTRACT

The proposal workshop is on Nanscale Science and
              Engineering (NSE) to explore the common challenges faced by the researchers in
              this area.  The goal is to foster interaction among researchers from academia
              as well as industry working in different NSE areas.  The format of the workshop
              is panel discussion to be held concurrently with the 2002 Annual AIChE meeting
              on November 3-8 in Indianapolis, IN.  In addition to the objectives outlined
              above, the workshop will serve to provide an opportunity for the AIChE
              attendees to broaden their awareness of the scope of NSE.
