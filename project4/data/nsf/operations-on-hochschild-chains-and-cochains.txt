              The investigator and his colleagues are going to study operations on deformation
              
complexes of various algebraic structures: in particular, operations on
              Hochschild 
cochains and chains of an associative algebra, and the deformation
              complex of 
d-algebras. 

The knowledge of operations on Hochschild (co)
              chains should be useful for 
Index theory on a (degenerate) Poisson manifold,
              which is of great importance 
for Poisson geometry. Also, the investigator is
              trying to find a general simple 
construction of an operad acting on a
              deformation complex of a general algebraic 
structure. This can be helpful in
              studying deformations of such objects as 
Hopf algebras.
