              0001354   Watts  The objective of this research is to understand the mechanisms
              of manganese oxide-catalyzed Fenton-like reactions and the conditions under
              which these reactions occur.  Preliminary results have shown that manganese
              oxide catalysts may produce reductants with as low as 0.0006 M (20 mg/L)
              hydrogen peroxide, one thousand times less than the concentration required in
              iron-catalyzed systems, potentially providing a more stoichiometrically
              efficient and economical system for the enhanced desorption and transformation
              of organic contaminants generated by industry and present at contaminated
              sites.  Specific objectives of the research include investigating process
              conditions that promote the generation of reductants in manganese
              oxide-catalyzed Fenton-like reactions; identifying the reductant species;
              investigating contaminant transformation pathways and potential for
              mineralization; and evaluating the generation of transient oxygen species from
              soil-catalyzed decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and their ability to desorb
              contaminants from soils and sludges.  The results of this research are expected
              to provide more effective and economical processes for the displacement and
              treatment of industrial contaminants from sludges and soils, promoting
              effective pollution prevention through volume reduction of process water and
              sludges and cleanup of source areas at contaminated sites.***
