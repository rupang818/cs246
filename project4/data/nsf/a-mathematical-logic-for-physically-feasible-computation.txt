              Two years of support are being requested if at all possible. The reason for this
              is 
because it is necessary to complete several key steps before submission as
              a regular 
proposal.  The first summer is to prepare papers for presentation
              and/or appearance in 
conferences and/or journals.  During the ensuing
              academic year, the intellectual content 
of this potentially controversial
              material will be circulated for comment, both publicly in 
talks and privately
              among colleagues.  Based on the feedback received, the ideas put forth 
will
              be modified and corrected. Only then does it make sense to use the following
              
summer to involve an undergraduate student in implementing the salient
              features of the 
proposed work for both a greater depth of understanding and
              demonstration purposes.  
  By this point in time, that would mean there
              should be preliminary results 
appearing in print, with supporting
              documentation on the web explaining this material.  
In addition, more capable
              assistive computing technology will be available by then (to 
help me overcome
              my hand disability), so that I might be able to more actively 
participate in
              the implementation details of that work.  When all of this is readily in place,
              
then it will be possible to submit a competitive regular proposal.
