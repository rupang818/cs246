Deficiencies exist in the current understanding of sulfate attack
              reaction kinetics and damage mechanisms, and this lack of understanding of
              reaction fundamentals limits the production of concrete that is expected to
              exhibit long-term durability in sulfate containing environments. A
              multi-disciplinary team has planned an integrated research program employing a
              combination of x-ray techniques to improve current understanding of sulfate
              transport and damage mechanisms in cement-based materials. Under this proposal,
              the application of three-dimensional x-ray microbeam diffraction mapping, x-ray
              microtomography (i.e., very high resolution computed tomography or CAT
              scanning), and soft x-ray microscopy for non-destructive, in situ examination
              of sulfate damage will be developed.
