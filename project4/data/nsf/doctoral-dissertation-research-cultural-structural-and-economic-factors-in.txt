This
              Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant proposes to take a more holistic
              approach to the examination of the emergence of new cultural product markets by
              examining the role of cultural, structural and economic factors.  Past
              sociological research has detailed the role of culture, social structure, and
              the state and public policy in the emergence of markets.  However, much of this
              work focuses on production factors associated with markets' emergence and
              generally highlights the social construction of markets.  The PIs suggest that
              markets are more driven by demand-side factors than factors of production. 
              This project will investigate how advertisers, consumers, and producers
              contributed to the emergence and accommodation of a new consumer specialty
              magazine market within that particular market sector.  The investigators argue
              that to truly understand markets, we must understand not only how markets are
              created and persist, but also how they are enabled by factors that are not
              exclusively social or economic.  Recent archival data and a content analysis of
              major U.S. newspapers and magazines will be used to examine how the new economy
              magazine market emerged and was legitimized by advertisers, consumers and
              producers.
