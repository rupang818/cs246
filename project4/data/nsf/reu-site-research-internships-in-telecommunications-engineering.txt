              the support of a five-year, REU Site " Research Internships in
              Telecommunications Engineering-RITE Site," under the direction of Dr. Steven I.
              Marcus. This eleven-week summer program will involve twenty-two students
              annually in a diverse research experience on a wide range of topics in the
              field of Telecommunications including communications systems and theory,
              networking, signal processing, multimedia technology, information security, and
              neuromorphic engineering. Each student will work in small groups (2-3 students)
              with faculty members and graduate students. In addition to the fundamental
              aspects of engineering disciplines, aspects of existing programs that combine
              engineering and business perspectives will be incorporated into the RITE
              students' experiences. The students will participate in industrial site visits
              and interactions and will work closely with graduate research assistant mentors
              throughout their summer research experience.
