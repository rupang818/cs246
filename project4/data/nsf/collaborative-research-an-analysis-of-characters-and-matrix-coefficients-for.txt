The aim of this project is to study the characters and
              matrix coefficients of the representations of the classical groups from the
              view point of the theory of reductive dual pairs. In particular of interest are
              formulas for the characters in terms of the natural moment maps, and the wave
              front sets. Regarding the matrix coefficients, the central question is to
              decide which absolutely integrable positive definite matrix coefficients have
              positive integral, and corollaries regarding the preservation of unitarity
              under Howe's correspondence.
We shall apply the ideas sketched above to signal
              processing. Specifically we are interested in the information compression and
              denoising of signals which are well balanced in the time-frequency domain.
