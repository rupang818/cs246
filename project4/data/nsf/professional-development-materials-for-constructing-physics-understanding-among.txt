              This project will develop a robust professional development package with three
              major components.  A set of curriculum materials to help prospective and
              practicing elementary teachers develop a deep understanding of physics ideas
              consistent with national standards will be developed along with materials which
              will help teachers understand how students learn these ideas.  Finally a set of
              materials will be developed to guide university faculty and professional
              development providers to use the materials described above.  Use will be made
              of exemplary computer technology.
