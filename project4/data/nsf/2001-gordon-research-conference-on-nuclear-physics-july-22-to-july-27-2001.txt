              This award will provide support for graduate students and junior
investigators
              to attend the Gordon Conference entitled, "QCD in
Extreme Conditions: High
              Temperature, High Density and small x." 
The conference will focus on issues
              relevant to heavy ion physics,
taking advantage of results from the first
              experimental run at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven
              National
Laboratory.  Approximately 20 speakers (divided roughly
              between
experiment and theory) have been invited according to their
expertise
              and leadership in the field.
