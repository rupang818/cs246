              The proposed research seeks to identify the causes for increased discharge from
              Russian rivers to the Arctic Ocean over the past 65 years.  The research will
              then attempt to place these trends into a longer-term (century to millennial
              time scale) context.  The first objective will be approached through
              quantitative analyses of daily discharge records from major Russian rivers over
              the past century, starting with a "data rescue" of paper-format records. 
              Securing the second objective will require modeling of paleo-discharge using
              publicly available tree ring data from well-distributed sites across Arctic
              Russia.  The research will result in a substantially improved understanding of
              spatial and temporate runoff patterns across the world's largest Arctic
              landmass, and a historical context by which to evaluate contemporary trends. 
              This understanding will help to answer questions about recent discharge
              increases, namely, "are they unprecedented?", "where is the water coming
              from?", and "what physical processes drive them?".
