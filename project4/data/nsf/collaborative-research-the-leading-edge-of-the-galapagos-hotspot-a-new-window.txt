              Recommended project is for an integrated marine field and laboratory
              investigation of the western end of the Galapagos archipelago, with a focus on
              studying lavas from the submarine western flanks of Fernandina and Cerro Azul
              volcanoes after mapping them with camera tows and multibeam and side scan
              sonar.  The goal is to define and then sample volcanic products from the
              leading edge of Galapagos plume, with associated, extensive geochemical and
              petrological studies that will help define the nature of the Galapagos plume. 
              These samples will be used to test whether magma chemistry from leading-edge
              plume volcanism indeed best reflects the chemistry of the plume mantle source,
              whether high 3He/4He does indeed reflect undegassed, deep mantle sources, and
              also to test whether the unique horseshoe-shaped pattern of Galapagos
              geochemical variation is due to mantle zonation or is instead related to other
              geologic processes.  The field mapping will determine whether there is a new
              submarine volcano westward of Fernandina that represents the actual plume
              leading edge (such as represented by Loihi in the Hawaiian plume volcanism), as
              suggested by seismic data.  This work, on the leading edge of a weak plume,
              will complement similar studies done at Hawaii, a strong plume, in testing
              models of plume volcanism and origin.
