This proposal aims
              at clearing the fundamental processes which will permit the design and
              construction of a new class of microsensors.  These will combine piezoelectric
              microcantilevers, nanostructured coatings (e.g. nanoporous silica), and
              biological detectors.  Their sensitivity should outperform existing piezoactive
              sensors by a factor of about 100.  The PI's have then engaged into an extremely
              detailed discussion of the key basic questions they felt should be explored
              before designers could depend on reliable, generic information: 1) the
              production of arrays of reduced-size microcantilever by sol/gel chemistry and
              soft lithography, as a way to collect from a given sample, many more
              simultaneous and real time bio-properties (e.g. in blood).  The enhancing
              effect of silica porosity is expected to be a major one (up to 500 m2/gram).
              One application of special interest would be, among others, the technology of
              biosensor microarrays for in vivo situations.  2) the bulk of the remainder of
              the proposal concerns the state of the art and proposed research departures of
              the key components of these diagnostics techniques: sensor performance
              (piezoelectric microcantilevers and nanostructures coatings), ceramics vs.
              quarts, micromanufacturing, modeling and size effects, biomolecules behavior in
              nanoporous media.
