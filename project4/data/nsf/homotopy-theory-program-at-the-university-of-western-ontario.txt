This award defrays travel costs for younger US-based
              participants to 
attend the Applied Homotopy Theory Program at the University
              of 
Western Ontario in September 2003.  The program will consist of a
              
one-week workshop for a large range of paricipants and, for the 
remainder
              of the month, a series of mini-courses to be given by 
five senior algebraic
              topologists from the US and Europe.  The support 
in this award will be used
              excusively to support the participation 
of US based advanced graduate
              students, mathematicians in post-doctoral 
positions, and a few selected
              tenure-track mathematicians.  Further 
information about the conference may be
              found at
