The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at the Brookhaven
              National
Laboratory allows for the first time the creation in the
              laboratory
of nuclear matter with energy density that exceeds the critical
              value
for making a transition into its constituent quarks and gluons.
              The
resulting quark-gluon plasma is believed to exist only in the interior
of
              neutron stars and during the first microsecond after the Big Bang.
Since the
              quark-gluon plasma is only formed for a brief time during
the early stage of
              heavy ion collisions, to verify its existence
and to study its properties pose
              a great challenge both experimentally
and theoretically. In this project, we
              shall develop a multiphase
transport model that can describe the interaction
              between incoming
nuclei, the subsequent formation of the quark-gluon plasma,
              the eventual
phase transition back to the hadronic matter, and the final
              expansion
of the hot dense hadronic matter. We will then use the model to
              find
possible signals for the quark-gluon plasma. In particular, we
              shall
investigate if effects due to the quark-gluon plasma can be seen
in the
              collective dynamics of final particles, in the photon and
dilepton spectra,
              and from the abundance of heavy particles that
consist of strange and charm
              quarks.
