              Sciences for FY 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              biophysics and is entitled "Protein Engineering of a Model Protein."  This
              study uses a synthetic diiron-oxo protein (DF) as a model for the class of
              metalloproteins that performs a variety of functions in living systems
              including dioxygen transport, conversion of ribonucleotides to
              deoxyribonucleotides, desaturation of fatty acids, and the solubilization and
              storage of iron.  DF has been designed to serve as a minimal model of
              diiron-oxo proteins and has been shown to contain a metal center that is very
              similar to the diiron-oxo proteins.  The model is interesting because the
              dinuclear metal centers in all diiron-oxo proteins contain many common
              structural features, but at the same time contain subtle differences that give
              rise to different activities.  This makes the diiron-oxo system attractive for
              studying how protein environments can influence active site functions.  This
              projects seeks to refine the first generation DF system into one that is
              amenable for engineering and designing efforts and for studying diiron-oxo
              protein function by (1) developing an efficient synthesis of DF which would
              offer a quick way to generate large numbers of DF variants and (2) by
              investigating the determinants for the function and structure of the center by
              systematically altering the atoms near the active site.  Completing these goals
              will guide efforts towards designing pre-defined functions into the diiron-oxo
              centers.
