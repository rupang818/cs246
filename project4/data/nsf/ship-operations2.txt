The University of Hawaii Manoa will operate the R/V
              Ka'Imikai-O-Kanaloa (KOK) during 2000 as a general oceanographic research
              vessel in support of NSF-supported research projects.  The KOK is a 223 ft.
              vessel, constructed in 1979 and modified in 1993, and is owned and operated by
              the State of Hawaii.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 145 operational
              days during 2000, of which 55 days are in support of NSF-supported
              investigators.  The remaining cruises will support NOAA, Navy, and NURP
              projects.  The projects scheduled on the KOK represent several oceanographic
              disciplines and programs such as HOT and and NOAA's MOBY program, involving
              ocean times series projects, process studies and assisting with mooring
              deployments/retrievals, thereby fully utilizing the vessel's capabilities.  The
              KOK will support use of the submersibles PISCES-IV and PISCES V.  Operations in
              2000 will mainly take place locally within 60 NM of Hawaiian territorial
              waters.

The RV Ka'Imikai-O-Kanaloa is part of a fleet of ships used by the
              National Science Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most
              oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment to be permanently
              installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized ships.  These
              vessels do not operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a
              result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated
              to oceanographic research that are operated by universities and institutions
              around the country.
