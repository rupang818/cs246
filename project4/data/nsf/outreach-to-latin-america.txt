              The American Physical Society (APS), in cooperation with the Mexican Physical
              Society (SMF) and the Federation of Latin American Physical Societies
              (FeLaSoFi), translates selected physics education materials into Spanish and
              makes them available to teachers throughout Latin America and in
              Spanish-speaking parts of the U.S.  Material describing simple and inexpensive
              physics experiments is translated into Spanish and teachers receive assistance
              in using the material with their students.  The project enhances collaboration
              in science education among the countries of the continent.
