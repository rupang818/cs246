              The objective of this New Technologies for the Environment project is to develop
              the new technologies needed in paper processing and agronomy to make mimosa
              (Albizia julibrissin) a viable materials substitute for hardwood fibers in fine
              paper manufacturing.  Quality writing and printing paper grades require a blend
              of long fibers derived from softwood and short fibers derived from hardwoods.
              Hardwoods are not plantation grown, making accessibility and proper
              reforestation difficult. Mimosa is a fast growing perennial plant and our
              preliminary studies show that it has pulp with qualities similar to that of
              southern hardwoods. This project focuses on studies that address:  (1) the
              response of mimosa to different pulping and paper making processes; (2) the
              response of mimosa to bleaching sequence; (3) the paper properties of mimosa in
              softwood and hardwood blends; (4) the optimum age of wood for mimosa
              harvesting; (5) genetic improvement of mimosa by making a germplasm (seed)
              collection from wild mimosa; and (6) evaluation of germination rate and early
              plant growth from this material.  The experiments synergize interactions among
              faculty and graduate students from Chemical Engineering, Agronomy and Soils,
              and the Auburn Pulp and Paper Research and Education Center. It includes
              research experiences for undergraduates in laboratory courses and through an
              undergraduate summer exchange program with minority students from Tuskegee
              University.

The environmental impacts of this work will be the reduction in
              harvesting of hardwoods in old growth forests, and the reduction in energy
              usage associated with the ease of pulping, bleaching, and refining of the
              mimosa fibers.
