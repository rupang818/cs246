This project will explore the possibility of using new
              techniques from computational intelligence in order to address the task of
              imputing missing values in data collected by complex arrays of sensors. 
              Sensors in a restricted environment can have readings relating to each other in
              such a matter that missing data from a set of failed sensors can be restored
              from the measurement of those remaining. When the reconstructed sensor readings
              are supplied as input to a process, the operation of the system is therefore
              still possible. Overall performance will degrade gracefully, if at all. 
              Discovery of data constraints can be achieved by training an autoencoder using
              sensor data. The trained encoder, having empirically discovered interrelations
              among data, can then be used to restore lost readings from failed sensors. This
              is achieved through either application of an alternating projection onto convex
              set (POCS) algorithm or a more conventional search.

Successful development
              of missing sensor data (MISED) restoration will have significant impact on a
              number of current technologies. The project will focus on applications to
              currently open and important problem in energy and avionics. The project has
              strong support from both industries.
