The project extends the electronic community to include those
              LSC projects which have recently "graduated" (reached the end of their NSF
              support).  Former projects receive continued access to LSC-Net and participate
              in research on aspects on sustainability.  The project design also includes an
              annual electronic conference with many special features catered to the needs of
              districts and educators.

The objectives are to continue to provide support
              and access to LSC-Net; to create additional functionality for, and implement a
              virtual conference on, sustainability; and to conduct collaborative research on
              sustainability within an LSC context.
