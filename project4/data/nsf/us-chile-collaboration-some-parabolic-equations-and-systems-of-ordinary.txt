Ward

This is a collaborative research project between Dr. James R.
              Ward of University of Alabama at Birmingham, and Dr. Raul Manasevich and Marta
              Garcia-Huidobro of Universidad de Chile and Pontifica Universidad Catolica de
              Chile respectively. The investigators intend to work on the mathematical
              analysis of boundary value problems for partial differential equations.  These
              problems appear in modeling both slow and fast diffusion, and are useful in the
              study of populations and diseases, porous media, and problems that are
              inherently nonlinear.  The investigators will use topological tools, such as
              degree and homotopy indexes, that are useful indicators of system
              behavior.

Each side brings their own strengths to the collaboration:  Drs.
              Garcia-Huidobro and Manasevich have extensive experience in quasilinear
              differential equations and bifurcations, while Dr. Ward has worked at length
              with the topological tools to be used in their joint effort.
