              The central theme of this proposal is the development of 
new methods for
              approximately solving the Schroedinger
equation for atomic nuclei and their
              application to problems of
contemporary importance in nuclear structure
              physics. Methods 
having their parentage in the nuclear shell model and in
              
mean-field theory will be considered, with the goal of developing
              
algorithms that significantly expand their ranges of applicability. 

A
              principal focus will be on the development of the
Density Matrix
              Renormalization Group (DMRG), a method 
first introduced in the context of
              quantum spin lattices. 
Here we will focus on a new DMRG methodology that is
              tailored 
to such finite fermi systems as the atomic nucleus. We will also
              
consider its application to an important non-nuclear problem, the
              
two-dimensional Hubbard model, which is of relevance to systems 
that
              undergo transitions to superconductivity at high critical 
temperatures. 

A
              second focus will be on the properties of
weakly-bound nuclei far from
              stability. A method recently 
proposed for reliably solving the Hartree Fock
              Bogolyubov 
mean-field equations for very weakly-bound nuclei will be
              
developed further, so as to make it computationally more viable, 
and will
              then be applied systematically to both spherical and 
axially-deformed nuclei
              throughout the periodic table. Other 
methods for solving the Hartree Fock
              Bogolyubov equations in 
weakly-bound systems will also be considered, to make
              sure 
that the spatial properties of such systems are being reliably
              
treated.
