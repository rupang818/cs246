              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Indiana University in
              Bloomington will acquire a Raman Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance
              research in a number of areas including a) studies of transition metal
              enediynes for photodynamic therapy; b) transition-metal diazo complexes:
              photoactivated nitrogen release for DNA cleavage; c) structural studies of
              glasses and glass-ceramics; d) 3d transition metal coordination clusters; e)
              Raman studies of C-H donation and of gas/solid reactivity; and f) fundamental
              studies on analytical Raman spectroscopy.  

A Raman spectrometer can provide
              important information about chemical reactivity from the scattered light as it
              passes through a transparent medium caused by changes in rotational or
              vibrational energy of the scattering molecules. Its use may enable
              breakthroughs in our understanding of the properties of reactive and
              nonreactive molecules.
