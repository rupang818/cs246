This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of Hawaii
              Manoa will provide support for acquisition of an isotope-ratio monitoring gas
              chromatograph/mass spectrometer system and related instrumentation for
              researchers at the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology.  It is
              expected that the new instrumentation will foster interdisciplinary approaches
              to a broad range of problems in isotopic research in marine chemistry, geology
              and biology, and related environmental sciences. University of Hawaii will
              contribute cost-sharing of more than 33% of the cost of this project from
              non-federal funds.
