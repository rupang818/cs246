              This project requests incremental funding for the Regional Laboratory for
              Applied Network Engineering Research and Training (RLANRT) project to build a
              living on-line repository for network engineering instructional materials and
              training.

Continual exponential growth in traffic and bandwidth usage is
              imposing severe strain on the Internet, and the gap between the immediate needs
              of the Internet infrastructure and current classroom content is growing.  New
              computer science and engineering solutions are needed, but producing the
              necessary skills and talent is hampered by the small size of the current pool
              of knowledgeable network engineering practitioners.

Under the auspices of
              RLANRT, JSU proposes to coordinate a Web-based repository for network
              engineering curriculum materials.  Resources are the current instructors from
              within and outside this institution, and Internet vendors such as CISCO, NOVEL,
              and Microsoft.  These vendors have a wealth of training materials related to
              their hardware and software, and the objective is to draw together the myriad
              topics in a continual updated resource for both teachers and infrastructure
              whose reliability and throughput at various levels will be secured by the
              activities of engineers, users, and service providers alike.
