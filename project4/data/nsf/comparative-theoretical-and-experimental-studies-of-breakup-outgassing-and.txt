It is proposed
              to investigate the process of liquid fragmentation when submitted to gas flow
              induced stresses or to cavitation related vapor states.  These effects are
              expected to be associated to high Weber number or very low-density conditions. 
              Several additional contributing factors to the liquid breakup mechanism will be
              investigated, such as morphology, molecular weights and viscoelastic
              properties.  In particular, the instabilities already identified as
              Rayleigh-Taylor in shock tube studies, will be now be considered from the
              Kelvin Helmhoz viewpoint, for such phenomena as stripping the side of the drop,
              the capillary instability of a filament pulled out of the drop, cavitation and
              outgassing. The focus of this part of the research is to explain the eventual
              droplet distribution as validated by high-speed movies and still photographs. 
              Also, the breakup of polymer-thickened liquids under low-pressure conditions
              has been shown to be very dependent on thickener concentration.  It is proposed
              to examined the dependence of such a process on polymer type, concentration and
              other related properties.
