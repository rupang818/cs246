              critical emerging technology fields, including the heterogeneous integration of
              nanoscale components and devices in microelectronics, information storage and
              optoelectronic systems. The ultra-fast temporal scale of femtosecond pulsed
              laser radiation will be combined with the high spatial resolution of near-field
              optical microscope for nanomachining. This hybrid single-step experimental
              methodology offers superior flexibility and control over the nanofabrication
              process. The project will encompass both basic investigation of the extremely
              rapid transport phenomena in nanometer length scales as well as the design and
              demonstration of novel practical processes for nanomachining and
              nanofabrication. The main objectives of the proposed research are given
              below:

1)	Development of experimental procedures for nanomachining by
              coupling femtosecond laser radiation with near-field optical
              microscopes.
2)	Detailed study of the fundamental mechanisms of the ultra-fast
              laser energy deposition and the ensuing nanoscale phase transformations by
              in-situ time-resolved optical spectroscopy.
3)	Investigation of the ultra-fast
              transport phenomena in the machining, cutting and joining of
              nanostructures.

In addition to the impact of the work in many nanotechnology
              applications, fundamental insight will be gained into the complex
              thermophysical phenomena in ultra-fast laser-induced nanoscale surface
              modification processes.  Funding is being provided by the Thermal Transport and
              Thermal Processing Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division and
              by the Nanomanufacturing Program of the Design, Manufacturing and Industrial
              Innovation Division.
