              The project will examine in greater detail the depth of thawing of the soils in
              northern Alaska.  Climate change is increasing the depth of thaw and eroding
              permafrost with concomitant impacts on vegetation, the hydrological balances,
              and human structures.  This research will refine existing methods for mapping
              the depth of thaw on local and regional scales.  The shallow thermal regime
              will be evaluated across a spectrum of spatial scales in order to elucidate the
              role of soil structure on heat transport.  The impact of heavy snow loading on
              the thaw depth will be examined based on manipulative experiments.  Also, the
              project will also examine the role of the heat island affect by a community in
              northern Alaska.
