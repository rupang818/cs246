              The Principle Investigator studies a new class of inequalities 
on the flag
              f-vector of convex polytopes. The flag f-vector 
contains all the enumerative
              incidence information between the 
faces of a polytope. Thus to classify the
              set of all possible 
flag f-vectors is one of the great open problems in
              discrete 
geometry.  To date only partial results to this problem have 
been
              obtained.  In a related problem, the Principle Investigator 
and his Research
              Assistant will study the homology groups of 
Newtonian coalgebras that arise
              in polytopal theory.  These 
homology groups were recently used to give an
              algebraic proof 
of the existence of the cd-index, an important invariant
              in
poset theory.  Understanding the homology of these chain 
complexes will
              give insight into new applications of Newtonian 
coalgebras.

Polytopes are
              basic mathematical objects that appear in 
discrete geometry.  The methods to
              attack these problems are 
unusually interdisciplinary as they involve
              insights from both 
geometry and algebra.  The results of this investigation
              are 
important as they relate both to the pure branches of 
mathematics, such
              as commutative algebra, algebraic geometry 
and Hopf algebras, and to the
              applied sciences, including 
optimization and computer science.  Understanding
              the enumerative 
information of polytopes will give a theoretical basis for
              stress 
and rigidity problems in mechanical engineering, for the
              
reconstruction using sampling problem in computer vision, and
              for
determining the complexity of geometrically-based problems
              in
optimization.
