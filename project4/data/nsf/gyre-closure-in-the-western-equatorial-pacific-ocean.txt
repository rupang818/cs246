This project seeks to untangle the complex pathways taken
              by water from different sources as they meet in the western tropical Pacific. 
              One particular premise that will be tested is the idea that the location and
              strength of the Mindanao and Halmahera Eddies and of the Mindanao Dome may
              exert a strong influence on the relative mixture of water masses entering the
              North Equatorial Countercurrent, the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) and the
              Indonesian Throughflow (ITF).   In part, this study is motivated by differences
              between the relative mixture of water of North and South Pacific origin in the
              EUC and ITF seen in data and the proportions seen in numerical general
              circulation models.   The approach involves the dynamical study of two process
              models.  One is a multi-layer diagnostic model, the second is a high-resolution
              version of the multi-layer POSEIDON model.  In addition, the variability of the
              tropical gyre closure in the output from a GFDL data assimilation run.
