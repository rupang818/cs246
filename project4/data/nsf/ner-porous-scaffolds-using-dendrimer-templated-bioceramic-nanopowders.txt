This project will investigate the synthesis route for making
              nano-powders of calcium phosphate based ceramics. It will explore the
              possibility of dendrimer mediated synthesis of nano-powders of calcium
              phosphate based ceramics that can be used for making dense and porous bone
              grafts with improved mechanical properties. Among various ceramic materials,
              calcium phosphate based ceramics are of significant interest because of their
              excellent biocompatibility. However, the composition suffer from poor
              mechanical properties due to sintering. The sinterability issues of these and
              other calcium phosphate based compositions will be evaluated using nano-sized
              powders. It is believed that the higher surface area of the starting
              nano-powders will increase the sintering kinetics, and better sintering will
              improve mechanical properties. The nano-powders will be synthesized by using
              different dendrimers via sol-gel synthetic route. Preliminary cell
              proliferation tests will also be conducted with these bone grafts.
