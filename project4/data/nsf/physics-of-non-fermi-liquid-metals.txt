This award supports theoretical research focused on: (1) how
              electron-electron interactions, possibly acting in concert with disorder, give
              rise to low-energy excitations that are distinctly non-Fermi liquid in
              character in high temperature superconductors, heavy fermion materials, dilute
              two-dimensional electron gases in Si-MOSFETs, and in other mesoscopic
              structures, and (2) elucidating the elementary excitations in real materials
              where non-Fermi liquid behavior has apparently been observed.  Four specific
              projects are proposed involving quantum critical behavior in heavy fermions,
              interacting electrons in disordered two-dimensional systems, probing
              spin-charge separation in the high temperature superconductors, and non-Fermi
              liquid behavior in mesoscopic systems.

The investigator will perform
              theoretical research that seeks to understand the nature of unusual low-energy
              electronic excitations observed in experiments on a variety of (usually low
              dimensional) materials. These excitations are not like those of ordinary metals
              and thus do not fit the standard textbook inspired expectation of a Fermi
              liquid. The mechanisms that can produce these kinds of excitations are poorly
              understood. Part of this proposal seeks to manipulate quantum dots to produce
              novel non-Fermi liquid states predicted by theory and may have bearing on
              developing electronic devices for a future technology.  This research lies at
              the frontiers of condensed matter theory and will contribute to the development
              of new theoretical techniques and to the training of the next generation of
              scientists in state-of-the-art methods for materials with strong electronic
              correlations and disorder.
