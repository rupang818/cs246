              In a joint project USGS, University of Mississippi and the DOE gathered
              single-channel seismic and ocean bottom seismometer data from the Gulf of
              Mexico gas hydrate environment. Initial results show free gas beneath a
              hydrate-bearing mud diapir but lacks a bottom-simulating reflector (BSR). The
              PIs propose to further develop an existing seismic tomography code to handle
              reflecting interfaces and converted shear waves in a self-consistent way. The
              code will be initially applied to an interesting gas hydrate problem from the
              Mississippi Canyon area in the Gulf of Mexico. The new technique will be used
              to learn: 1) how far does the shallow hydrates extend beneath the seafloor?, 2)
              does free gas exist beneath shallow hydrates and if so, what traps it?, 3) why
              is there no BSR present. The existing 3D data will be optimized and a method
              will be developed for 3D PS-NMO based on tomographic inversion.
