Title:	"Geological and Geotechnical Engineering in the New
              Millennium: Opportunities for Research and Technological Innovation"
 
In
              response to a request from the National Science Foundation, the National
              Research
Council will provide advice on future research directions in
              geological and geotechnical
engineering.  A study will be conducted by an ad
              hoc committee under the aegis of the Committee on Geological and Geotechnical
              Engineering, a standing committee under the Board on Earth Sciences and
              Resources.  The study will concentrate on techniques for characterizing,
              stabilizing, modeling, and monitoring the subsurface.  In particular, the
              committee will examine
current technologies and methodologies and will
              identify research priorities, opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration
              and technological innovation, and applications of information and computer
              technology advancements.
