CAREER: Long-term changes in synaptic function induced by
              selective
suppression of activity in single neurons

The adaptation of the
              brain to environmental changes is achieved in part
through modifications in
              the strength of synapses, which are specialized
connections between neurons.
              The precise rules governing synapse
formation, maturation and subsequent
              modification in the central nervous
system are not fully understood. Using
              electrophysiology, fluorescence
microscopy and molecular biological tools, Dr.
              Murthy will investigate
long-term modification of identified synapses in a
              simple neural network
in vitro. The overall research objectives of the
              proposal are (i) to
determine the consequences of selective, long-term
              reduction of activity
in a single neuron within an active network, and (ii) to
              understand the
locus and mechanisms in synaptic modification resulting from
              this
manipulation.

Two general classes of results might be anticipated -
              homeostatic
modifications that allow neuron-wide increase in synaptic strength
              that
will restore the overall activity of the 'quiet' cell to normal
              levels,
and competitive modifications that reduce or eliminate synaptic input
              and
output of the 'quiet' cell. This experimental system will
              offer
unparalleled access to detailed cell biological investigations of
              synaptic
modification - from the level of gene expression to physiological
              analysis
at single synapse resolution. The investigator will also
              integrate
education with his research program by developing up-to-date
              instructional
material for an advanced course in neuronal cell biology. Since
              optical
microscopy has become an indispensable tool in cellular-level
              research,
Dr. Murthy will organize short departmental workshops on advanced
              imaging
techniques. In addition to these instructional elements, the
              investigator
will also mentor undergraduate and graduate students, including
              those from
underrepresented groups.
