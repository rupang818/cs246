The research and training plan are in the area of
              evolution of development and is entitled "Evolutionary Rate and Pattern in
              Developmentally-regulated Genes in Malaria and Related Parasites."  Malaria
              parasites (Plasmodium) and some other members of their phylum, Apicomplexa,
              have nuclear ribsomal DNA  with an unusual organization.  Unlike most other
              eukaryotes, these protozoans have only a few, independently-evolving rDNA loci,
              and at least in malaria, these genes may be expressed only at specific times in
              the parasites' development.  The goal of this research is to identify when in
              the evolutionary history of this phylum the peculiar organization of these
              genes arose as well as to examine in detail the rate and pattern of the
              evolution of these genes.  Evolutionary genomics, structural biology, and the
              use of large databases of sequence data are among the bioinformatic approaches
              being used.
