              This project includes two mathematics mini-courses to be part of an enhanced
              group of mathematics activities at the 2003 Conference of the Society for
              Advancement of Chicano and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) to be held on
              October 2-5, 2003 in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Each mini-course will consist
              of
six one-hour lectures by two instructors: an established mathematician with
              an excellent record of research, mentoring and teaching, and a junior
              mathematician who has demonstrated exceptional mentoring ability while carrying
              out an outstanding research and teaching program.  The mini-course topics will
              be
"Coding Theory" and "Explorations in Mathematical Biology."

The purpose
              of each mini-course is to expose a large number of minority students (advanced
              undergraduates and graduate students)to a topic in applied or pure mathematics
              with particular emphasis on diverse approaches to problems, and connections to
              other areas of mathematics or other disciplines.  The mini-courses are expected
              to reach a point when open problems that have the potential to grow into
              graduate research projects can be stated in context.  This is designed to
              encourage students to continue on to graduate school and boost their confidence
              by making them realize that, even at this stage, they are able to
              understand
the nature of motivating questions.
