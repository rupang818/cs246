Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, in collaboration with the
              University of Texas at El Paso and CODAR Ocean Sensors, proposes to extend High
              Frequency (HF) Radar data processing and hardware to improve the measurement of
              surface currents and wave conditions, and to incorporate directly into radar
              data output both transport and water quality model coefficients. The
              collaboration between these Minority Institutions and Industry partner will
              extend HF-Radar applications to predict the origins and fates of oil spills,
              water quality, thermal and contaminant plume tracking, study coastal processes,
              and develop improved techniques of real-time management, display and
              distribution of HF-Radar data. In addition, the extended HF-Radar system will
              improve navigational safety for Texas ports and waterways, which involve
              complicated hydrodynamic systems with shallow enclosed, embayment features.
