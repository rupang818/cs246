              The proposal will provide funding to establish a beginning collaboration between
              Idaho State University and Triangle Universities Nuclear Lab at a critical time
              in the PI's career.  The new high intensity gamma ray source is based on
              Compton backscattering of the FEL photons generated by an electron bunch ion
              the storage ring with a second electron bunch to produce an intense beam of
              linearly polarized gamma rays.  The new technology which will produce a gamma
              ray flux at least 1000 times as great as anything presently available will
              allow model independent determination of nucleon polarizabilities via Compton
              scattering.  The award is funded by the NSF POWRE program, the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities in the MPS Directorate, and the Physics Division.
