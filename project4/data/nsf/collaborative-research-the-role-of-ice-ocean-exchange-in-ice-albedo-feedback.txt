              This research will examine and quantify the impact of ice-ocean heat exchange on
              the ice-albedo feedback mechanism using SHEBA data and a hierarchy of ice-ocean
              models ranging from simple turbulence scaling to large eddy simulations.  The
              role of under-ice roughness altering the vertical turbulent fluxes of heat, of
              open water conditions found in leads, and of summer-time melt-water
              stratification in would be investigated.  Improved parameterizations for this
              heat exchange over area scales of 10-100 km would be developed for use in large
              scale regional and global models.  These parameterizations would then be tested
              in these larger scale models.  The results will lead to be forecast capability
              of global ocean-climate models.
