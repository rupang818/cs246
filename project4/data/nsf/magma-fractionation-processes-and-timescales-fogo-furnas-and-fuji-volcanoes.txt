              Magma Fractionation Processes and Timescales: Fogo, Furnas and Fuji
              Volcanoes

EAR- 0207529 
PI: Widom

This project is a combined
              volcanological, geochemical, isotopic and geochronologic study of recent,
              highly evolved and chemically zoned eruptive products of Fogo and Furnas
              volcanoes in the Azores (Portugal), and Fuji volcano in Japan. The project will
              involve petrographic and microprobe analysis, major and trace element and
              Sr-Nd-Pb isotope analysis, and U-series disequilibria studies of whole rock
              pumices and mineral and glass separates, as well as high precision Ar-Ar dating
              of feldspar separates. Specific questions that will be addressed include the
              role of open vs. closed system processes during magmatic differentiation, the
              timescales over which magma differentiation and chemical zonation occur, and
              the relationship between magma residence timescales and eruptive volumes. The
              combined studies of eruptions from the Azores and Fuji will allow comparisons
              of the processes and timescales operating in magmatic systems in distinct
              tectonic settings (intraplate vs. subduction zone), and in magmatic systems
              that are compositionally distinct (alkaline vs. calc-alkaline).
