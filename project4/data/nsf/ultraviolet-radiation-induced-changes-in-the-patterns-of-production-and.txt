There is sufficient evidence to show that present levels of
              incident ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 280-400nm) are impairing phytoplankton
              productivity in the Southern Ocean. Yet, efforts at extrapolating these
              findings to allow accurate and unambiguous predictions of the consequences of
              UVR on the Antarctic marine food web and biogeochemical cycles in the sea have
              been confounded with uncertainty. Estimated impacts to the Antarctic marine
              ecosystem range from insignificant to catastrophic. This disparity has been
              attributed to lack of information in key areas of UVR photobiology and
              photochemistry. Generally, studies have been based on broadband UVR, and do not
              take into account competing responses of phytoplankton at different wavelengths
              across the UVR waveband. Such information is critical if we are to understand
              the consequences of UVR enhancement on carbon assimilation by marine
              phytoplankton and its consequences for the food web and biogeochemical cycles.
              This is especially true in regions like the Antarctic where stratospheric ozone
              concentrations can decrease by about 50% each spring altering the proportion of
              UVB (280-320nm) and UVA (320-400nm) radiation that phytoplankton receive during
              their growth season. This project will systematically investigate changes in
              the production rates and composition of biochemical compounds within Antarctic
              phytoplankton cells under spectrally defined conditions. Investigations of both
              laboratory cultures and natural populations of Antarctic phytoplankton will be
              undertaken to understand 1) how phytoplankton cellular biochemical processes
              are impacted by the interplay between the different UVR wavelengths and visible
              light, 2) how UVR sensitivity varies across taxonomic groups of phytoplankton
              and 3) whether this difference in sensitivity is responsible for the dominance
              of one species over the other. The effect of UVR exposure on nutrient uptake by
              phytoplankton cells will also be studied. This information will help ascertain
              the role of UVR in the phytoplankton dynamics of the Southern Ocean.
