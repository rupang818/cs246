              Abstract 0075519 

This project will investigate the changing lives of
              industrial workers in a large motorcycle manufacturing factory in Faridabad,
              India.  Work processes and conditions have changed dramatically with industrial
              globalization, including new Japanese-style systems of shopfloor organization,
              increased casualization of the labor force, and the weakening of trade unions. 
              This has made industrial labor more contentious and the lives of workers
              outside the factory (social networks) in flux. The researchers will analyze how
              workers respond to (comply with or resist) changing forms of labor organization
               and how workers perceive and structure their lives in the context of
              industrial globalization.  Methods include participant observation, structured
              interviews with workers, managers, union leaders and others, and an intensive
              analysis of shopfloor politics with a core sample of workers. This project will
              contribute to  our understanding of how industrial workers in the developing
              world are responding to new forms of industrial capitalism.
