              Provenance and data derivation are important to many aspects of scientific
              computation. In 
molecular biology, where data is repeatedly copied,
              corrected, and transformed as it passes 
through numerous genomic databases,
              understanding where data has come from and how it 
arrived in the user's
              database is of crucial to the trust a scientist will put in that data, yet this
              
information is seldom captured properly.  In astronomy, useful results may
              have been been 
obtained by filtering, transforming, and analyzing some base
              data by a complex assemblage of 
programs, yet we lack good tools for
              recording how these programs were connected and the 
context in which they
              were run. 
The intellectual merit of the proposed activity lies in the new
              insights that it will bring to the 
important topics of data provenance and
              data derivation.  
The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity
              relate primarily to the establishment of 
new ties between distinct
              disciplines that have strong interests in data derivation and provenance 
but
              have not, historically, talked to each other. These new ties will tend to
              accelerate both 
research and education in the participating disciplines.
