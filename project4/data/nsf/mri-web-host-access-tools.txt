MRI:  Web Host Access
              Tools

This is a cooperative effort among computing faculty at Villanova
              University and the College of New Jersey and the objective is the acquisition
              of web host access tools.  The combined research activities address important
              questions in artificial intelligence, information gathering, human-computer
              interface and networking all in the context of a common problem. The problem
              that joins these topics is assisting a user retrieving and using information
              obtained from the World Wide Web. The actives involve an integration of
              research and education with an explicit goal to introduce students to a
              significant research project while advancing the state of the art in enhanced
              web resource access.
