              Global climate change affects the long-term availability and short-term
              variability of water resources. Potential regional impacts could include
              increased frequency and magnitude of droughts and floods, and long-term changes
              in mean renewable water supplies through changes in precipitation, temperature
              and other factors. Given the tremendous uncertainty that exists regarding the
              impacts of global climate change on regional water supplies, it would be of
              great value to identify institutional means of increasing the responsiveness of
              water demand to changes in scarcity. This study expands the growing climate
              change literature to address the critical question of water resource response
              strategies.

This project analyzes water system flexibility by estimating the
              effects of higher prices, alternative price structures and non-price utility
              conservation policies on water demand in 12 U.S. cities. While price is
              theoretically the more cost-effective tool, in a second-best world, price
              increases sufficient to induce water conservation are not always politically
              feasible; efficiency and watersavings comparisons of price and non-price tools,
              and among various non-price tools, are therefore critical. This research
              assesses the potential of price and non-price water conservation policies as
              climate change response strategies and scarcity management tools.

              specifically, the project econometrically estimates household responsiveness to
              changes in water price, conservation incentives, regulations and education
              programs, controlling for differences in consumers' economic, social and
              climatic environment. To that end, the research team has obtained the first
              specific data on residential end-uses of water in multiple U.S. cities, which
              precisely disaggregate all household water uses (i.e., shower, indoor faucet,
              toilet, dishwasher, leak, swimming pool, hot tub, sprinkler) from total metered
              consumption. The proposed approach models demand for each specific end use
              individually, using seemingly unrelated regression estimation (SURE)
              techniques. Finally, the project will estimate the portion of cross-city
              variation in price elasticity that is due to factors beyond the control of
              policymakers, like income or family size, as well as that portion that can be
              highly sensitive to policy, like appliance choices. The research provides an
              approximate upper bound on the magnitude of water conservation achievable
              through reasonable price and non-price policies in the urban residential
              sector. These results will provide information critical to utilities,
              governments and society at large, which face increased variability and scarcity
              of water resources due to climate change.

The research  establishes reliable
              estimates of the price elasticity of demand for water in specific household
              activities. With this information, household water uses can be ranked according
              to their price-responsiveness, an indicator of both the value of specific water
              uses and the extent to which savings are possible in these uses. Having
              identified the water uses that consumers, themselves, will reduce, given the
              shift in budget constraint caused by a price increase or change in price
              structure, the project determines which types of non-price policies most
              closely resemble price changes, in terms of their effect on water demand. This
              is the first attempt to identify specific potential efficiency improvements in
              non-price utility conservation programs. The research also augments the
              conflicting evidence available on the absolute and relative effectiveness of
              non-price water demand policies.
