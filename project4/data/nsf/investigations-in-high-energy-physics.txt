              Research focussed on quantitative investigations of the strong nuclear forces
              will be performed.  The study of the strong forces among elementary particles
              using quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the strong force, is of critical
              importance in interpreting the results of experiments using high energy
              accelerators and in testing the validity of quantum chromodynamics as a central
              component of the "Standard Model" of elementary particles.  The planned
              research, which will approximate space by a discrete lattice of points and use
              computers extensively, will also contribute to the important national goal of
              extending the capabilities of massively parallel supercomputers and of building
              a pool of mathematical physicists skilled in state of the art of computational
              physics.
