              Brooks Pate of the University of Virginia is supported by a grant from the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to develop a new molecular beam
              spectrometer and to use it to study gas phase isomerization initiated by
              vibrational laser excitation.  Isomerization rates will be determined using
              Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy.  These data will be used to test
              dynamical theories.  The studies will be augmented by studies of isomerization
              in solution using two-color, time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy and a
              comparison will be made to distinguish solvent effects.  Isomerization will be
              studied for a series of systems with two and three (epoxides) conformational
              minima and for systems (terminal chloroalkynes and linear aldehydes) with
              multiple isomerization coordinates.

Isomerization, the change in structure
              of an isolated molecule, greatly effects chemical reactivity, a feature that is
              exploited by long chain molecules and in biological systems.  Isomerization is
              to be studied by advanced spectroscopic techniques in both the gas and solution
              phases to test theoretical models and to determine the influence of the solvent
              on the reactivity.
