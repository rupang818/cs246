              This award provides funding to Pennsylvania State University for the support of
              a three-year REU Site in Innovative Sintered Products, under the direction of
              Dr. Renata S. Engel.  This ten-week summer research experience for ten
              undergraduate students each year,  will focus on the interdisciplinary theme of
              sintered products.  The program will be housed in the newly created
              interdisciplinary Center for Innovative Sintered Products (CISP), an
              industry-university-government partnership for performing innovative research,
              education, and outreach activities.  CISP is ideally suited to administer a REU
              site due to its interdisciplinary focus, innovations in research and education,
              and ability to mentor students in technical training and professional
              development. The research projects that the students will participate in  deal
              with an array of interdisciplinary topics that will move an enitre industry
              segment into the next century through coordinated technical innovation,
              education and outreach.
