              This project is an effort to use aerosol source apportionment to study the
              origin, transformations, and light scattering properties of aerosols in the
              outflow of Eastern Asia.  This study will be carried out in the context of the
              ACE-Asia experiment.  Aerosols will be collected for this study at Cheju
              Island, Korea and ground sites in China.  The analyses will include a broad
              range of organic and inorganic compounds, and stable isotope ratios of
              important tracer elements.  These analyses will involve ion chromatography, gas
              chromatography with mass spectrometric detection, and magnetic-sector,
              multi-collector inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry.  This is a
              collaborative effort involving investigators from Georgia Institute of
              Technology, NCAR, and Oregon State University.
