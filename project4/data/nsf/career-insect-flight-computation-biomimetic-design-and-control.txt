The proposed research
              is a computational study of insect flight, a problem which has been studied
              mostly by experimental means heretofore. Unlike aerodynamics of conventional
              wings, the present problem deals with flow over flexible wings at low Reynolds
              numbers.  It is always unsteady, involves simultaneous generation of lift and
              thrust by the wing, and strong interactions between the large vortices shed
              from the leading edge and the rest of the wing.  The PI proposes to carry out
              the simulation by using the Submerged Boundary Method and vortex dynamics
              models.  Successful methods developed for biomimetics will be useful for
              simulating aerodynamics of micro air vehicles.
