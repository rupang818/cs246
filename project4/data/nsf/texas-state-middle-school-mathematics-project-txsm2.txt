              Submitted under the guidelines for Teacher Enhancement, Teacher Retention and
              Renewal, this is a 36-month  project to offer a graduate leadership program in
              middle school mathematics to 100 teacher leaders.  The teacher leaders will
              complete a 36-hour master's degree in mathematics content and pedagogy, and in
              leadership/mentoring.  The project will include both residential and on-line
              components.  It is a collaborative effort among Southwest Texas State
              University, Stephen F. Austin State University, Sam Houston State University,
              the Texas Statewide Systemic Initiative, the Texas Rural Systemic Initiative,
              and K-12 partner schools.  

The project builds upon successful
              collaborations in pre-service with the intent to provide leaders who can mentor
              the new inductees.   It will combine face-to-face meetings in the summer and
              weekend immersion during the academic year, along with internet coursework and
              interactive distance learning.
