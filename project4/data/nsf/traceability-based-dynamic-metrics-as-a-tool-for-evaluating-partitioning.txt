              This research investigates a new method of assessing predicted
              performance
characteristics of Object-Oriented software architectures. As
              scenarios
represent the anticipated runtime behavior of a system, they can be
              used at
a very early stage in the design to quantitatively predict aspects of
              that
behavior. The proposed approach can be applied earlier than other
              existing
methods such as simulations and executable designs, and does not
              require
special analytical skills.  Early assessment is an important risk
              mitigation
technique, that can contribute significantly to the task of
              building a
distributed system with a greater degree of confidence in its
              ability to
perform as required.

The research involves formally defining a
              set of scenario-based metrics and
a corresponding system-wide dynamic metrics
              model.  A strongly typed
traceability scheme is defined to support the
              definition and automated
querying of relationships between performance
              requirements, scenarios, and
architectural components.  Scenario invocation
              rates are specified within
the context of typical usage patterns, and the
              relationship between
scenarios is investigated to determine when performance
              requirements should
be propagated from one scenario to another.  A supporting
              tool is developed
and used to capture metrics and validate them against
              runtime and simulation
measurements taken from a variety of distributed
              systems.
