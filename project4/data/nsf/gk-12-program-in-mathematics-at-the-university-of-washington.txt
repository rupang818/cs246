              This project leverages several K-12 outreach programs at the University of
              Washington to help increase the subject-matter understanding of precollege
              mathematics teachers and their students while increasing the Fellows'
              understanding of teaching and learning. The College of Arts and Sciences, as
              home of the departments that teach mathematics and the sciences, has a long
              history of preservice and inservice teacher preparation. The proposal seeks to
              place 12 graduate students (recruited university wide) as GK-12 Fellows in
              local elementary and junior high mathematics classes. The project will involve
              a coordinated program of selection, initial preparation, in-depth preparation,
              on-going mentoring and assessment. Feasibility has been demonstrated by a
              two-year pilot project supported by the UW President's Fund and NSF. Fellows
              will receive initial preparation in instructional methods of inquiry based
              mathematics by Lillian McDermott and the Physics Education group followed by
              Developing Mathematical Ideas session to analyze student thinking given by the
              Expanding a Community of Mathematics Learners local systemic change project.
              This GK-12 projects extends partnerships with local school districts already
              involved in systemic change efforts and strengthens on-going attempts to help
              teachers implement curricula that meet state and national standards.
