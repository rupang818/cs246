The detailed structure of the Tonga subduction zone is being
              studied with seismic data from two dense seismic arrays. The arrays are to be
              deployed for about a year, one within the active island arc (Tonga), the other
              in the backarc environment (Fiji). Data from the arrays is used to characterize
              and model seismic wave propagation effects within the subducting oceanic plate
              and the adjacent mantle. These wave propagation effects result from
              interactions with seismic velocity discontinuities in and near the subducting
              plate. The depths, velocity contrasts, and sharpness of the velocity
              discontinuities will be used to help better understand the temperature,
              mineralogy and presence of water in the subducting slab and the surrounding
              mantle at greater spatial detail than is possible from data recorded
              teleseismically. Dense array data also allows higher precision studies of the
              mechanics of deep earthquakes.
