Rotating convection, in
              which buoyant and non-inertial forces govern the resulting motion, are of
              importance in geophysical as well as some technological flows.  The
              computational description of these flows represents a significant challenge and
              the developing techniques of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) provide a logical
              method of approach.  The PI will use one of the advanced subgrid models: the
              "estimation model", to attack this complex fluid dynamics problem.  The
              success/failure of these computations will be instructive in evaluating the
              efficacy of the estimation model.
