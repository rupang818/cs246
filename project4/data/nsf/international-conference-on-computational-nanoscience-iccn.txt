Title	International Conference on
              Computational Nanoscience (ICCN)


Computational analysis of the nanoscale
              structures, systems, and processes play a critical role to provide insight into
              different approaches in nano science and engineering.  However, this field is
              in the early stages of development.  The Computational Nanoscience Conference
              will provide a forum for broad discussion of methods and ideas that will
              otherwise be limited to a relatively small group of investigators.  It will
              furthermore encourage the participation of students and faculty early in their
              career to engage in this important field.  The international participation will
              allow the most advanced methods and ideas to be discussed and evaluated.
