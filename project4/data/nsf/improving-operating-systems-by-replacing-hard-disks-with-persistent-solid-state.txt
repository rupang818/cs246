              The use of persistent RAM in consumer products has increased its capacity and
              decreased its price. These trends suggest that typical computers could contain
              large quantities of this kind of memory in the near future.  This project will
              investigate how to change operating system design for workstation and server
              machines to make best use of the availability of large quantities of persistent
              RAM.  In particular, the project will investigate the use of persistent RAM for
              a machine's primary stable storage, replacing hard disks.  The project will
              perform a test design and implementation to demonstrate the feasibility of the
              concept and to suggest possible advantages of the approach.  This
              implementation will be performed on a Linux system augmented with 2 Gbytes or
              more of RAM that will serve as its primary storage device, with a hard disk
              used only for large files, such as video and audio data.  The project will
              demonstrate advantages in speed and simplicity of the system.  It will also
              point out interesting possibilities for improvements in operating system
              services made possible by the use of persistent RAM.
