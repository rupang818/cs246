This award provides support for the Symposium Balancing Costs
              with Benefits of Health Care Technologies in the New Millennium: A Global
              Perspective. The Symposium is being held in conjunction with the World Congress
              on Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering (July 23-28, 2000), an activity
              organized by the International Union for Physics and Engineering in Medicine
              and six major domestic U.S. and international professional societies in the
              field of biomedical engineering. The Congress is a major international meeting
              with 19 international organizations cooperating to make it a success.  

The
              Symposium program includes three sessions, each with a plenary address,
              presentations and a panel discussion. The sessions are:

1. Cost-Reducing
              Health Care Technologie--the NSF/Whitaker Foundation experiment
2. Cost Versus
              Benefits: A National Perspective
3. Technology Transfer: A Global
              Perspective

Proceedings of the World Congress Symposium are to be published
              jointly with those of the American Association for the Advancement of Science
              (AAAS) Symposia to be held at the 2000 AAAS meeting "Science in an Uncertain
              Millennium" (Washington, DC, 17-22 February 2000): (1) Healthcare Technology,
              Economics, and Policy: an Evolving Balance, and (2) Cost-Reducing Health Care
              Technology.
