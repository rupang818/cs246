Assessing the relative contributions of enriched mantle
              and continental crust to
continental flood basalt lavas is a long-standing
              problem, because essentially the same
whole-rock geochemical data can be used
              to argue for either case. We propose a test
using the Columbia River Basalt
              Group, the best-studied flood basalt province in the
world. We shall use laser
              ablation sampling in combination with multicollector
inductively coupled
              plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) to establish whether or not
plagioclase
              phenocrysts in CRBG lavas exhibit zoning in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr. Because
              plagioclase
crystallizes from basaltic liquids at crustal pressures, this will
              establish whether or not the
magmas experienced changes in Sr isotope ratio
              during residence in (or transport
through) the crust. While laser ablation
              MC-ICP-MS for in-situ isotope ratio analysis is
not yet a fully developed
              technique, Sr in plagioclase has been demonstrated as feasible,
and presents
              relatively few analytical challenges. This research has the potential to
              place
unequivocal spatial constaints on the depth at which lithosperic
              contamination has
affected the compositions of the Columbia River lavas. The
              results will affect our
understanding of mantle plume-lithosphere interactions
              during genesis of this flood basalt
province.
