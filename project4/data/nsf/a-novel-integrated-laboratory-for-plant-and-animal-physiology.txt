              Biological Sciences (61) To fully understand how organisms work, biologists in
              the post- genomic era must find new ways to incorporate our abundant molecular
              data into the larger context of cellular and organismal physiology. Towards
              this end, we are strengthening the physiology curriculum at Harvey Mudd College
              by adding a new Comparative Physiology Laboratory. This course accompanies a
              sophomore- level lecture course, Structure and Function, which covers cellular,
              animal, and plant physiological mechanisms. The laboratory course uses the
              novel approach of presenting physiology as a set of unique solutions to common
              problems. Animal, plant and fungal models are being used as systems in which to
              examine energetics, ionic regulation and signaling. The course is structured to
              allow both breadth and depth. During the first nine weeks, students perform a
              wide range of exercises, many of which are adapted from other successful
              laboratory courses developed at other institutions (e.g., Grinnell College,
              Swarthmore College, Pomona College, University of New Hampshire). In a second
              meeting each week, students complete each exercise by developing a testable
              hypothesis about the system. These hypotheses provide the starting point for
              self- initiated research projects designed, carried out and presented by
              students in the final five weeks of the course.
