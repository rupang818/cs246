              The PIs will test the GLOBEC core hypothesis that production regimes in the
              Coastal Gulf of Alaska and Califomia Current System covary, and are coupled
              through atmospheric and oceanic forcing, through comparative analysis of
              zooplankton populations and measures of atmospheric and oceanic forcing in
              different regions of the NE Pacific. During a Phase 1 study, the PIs uncovered
              substantial changes in the California Current zooplankton (Region I) on
              interdecadal time scales (e.g., changes in salp and euphausiid regimes) as well
              as interannual time scales (e.g., El Nino-related changes in copepod diversity
              and zooplankton biomass). For Phase 2 , the PIs will focus on Region II of the
              CCS off central/northern California to determine whether the pronounced
              perturbations that they detected are spatially coherent in different regions of
              the CCS and are linked to zooplankton fluctuations elsewhere in the NE Pacific,
              specifically off Oregon and in the Coastal Gulf of Alaska.  In addition,
              estimates of instantaneous, stage-specific mortality rates for euphausiid
              populations of the NE Pacific will be made using lipofuscin-based measures of
              euphausiid age and inverse modeling techniques. Long-term stability in food web
              structure also will be investigated using zooplankton stable isotopes.
