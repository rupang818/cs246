ABSTRACT CMS0099724 
              "Analysis of Lifeline Damages and Economic Impacts of an Earthquake: 
              Development of an Integrated Economic-Engineering Assessment Model

Research
              will be carried out by the colleagues in the U.S. (University of Illinois/SUNY
              @ Buffalo) and Japan (Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry),
              who have been collaborating on the development of regional and interregional
              economic impact and forecasting models for both countries for over three
              years.

An integrated economic-engineering model will be cdonstructed to
              estimate the indirect impacts of an earthquake and to simulate recovery
              activities and its system-wide effects.  The project will build on a set of
              recently completed models, including an engineering model for assessing the
              lifeline damages in an urban area and economic models for estimating the
              indirect impacts and effects of an earthquake in urban, regional, and
              interregional contexts.  Attention is directed to the integration of the
              engineering model and economic models, systematically connecting time, space,
              and the damages between two different modeling schem3s.

Once completed,
              analysis will focus on the following policy implications: a) evaluation of
              retrofit strategies on lifeline systems; b) sensitivity analysis of emergency
              management plans; and c) life cycle assessment of lifeline facilities aganist
              earthquakes.  The constructed integrated model will also provide the
              information on the propagation paths of the economic impacts in an
              interregional context, the relationshop between physical damages and economic
              impacts, and the time series analysis of the economics impacts focusing on
              production chronologies.  The interregional focus derives from urban areas;
              increasing dependence on external markets
for sources of inputs and as
              destinations for the consumption of goods and services produced in the urban
              area.  The major contributions will lie in the way in which different
              engineering and economic modeling paradigms are integrated, the perspectives
              that can be learned from experience in other countries and the identification
              of crwitical linkages that needs to be explored to assist in recovery efforts.
