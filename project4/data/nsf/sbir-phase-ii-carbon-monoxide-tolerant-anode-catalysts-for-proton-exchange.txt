              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to
              implement a  Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition (CCVD) process for the
              production of anode electrocatalyst layers for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel
              Cell (PEMFC) applications requiring reformate fuel feed gas.  In Phase I it was
               demonstrated  that fabrication of Pt:Ru electrocatalysts as unsupported,
              metallic nanoparticles is possible using CCVD. These electrocatalyst layers
              behave electrochemically in a similar manner to commercially available Pt:Ru
              electrocatalysts prepared on carbon supports using wet chemical methods, but
              can be deposited directly onto both gas diffusion media and proton exchange
              membranes. The Phase II project would involve optimization of catalyst
              composition, continued development of web coating technology for mass
              production of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) and commercialization of the
              technology through construction of production equipment and licensing.

Fuel
              cells are of huge interest to the marketplace, as illustrated by sizable
              investments in the technology and market capitalization of fuel cell companies.
              For example, Daimler Chrysler has targeted the year 2004 for planned production
              of fuel cell vehicles, and has slated more than $1.4 billion in investments to
              reach that goal. However, for commercial viability, performance and cost of the
              electrocatalyst layers must be improved. MCT, if successful, could contribute
              in both arenas.
