              A broad program of research in elementary particle physics and an associated
              education and outreach program are proposed by a research group from the
              University of Chicago Physics Department with Henry Frisch as the P.I.   Their
              program includes: the ATLAS detector construction project, which will be at the
              energy frontier at CERN's Large Hadron Collider; the CDF collaboration that
              shared in the discovery of the top quark at the Fermilab proton-antiproton
              collider and is operating at the current energy frontier; the OPAL
              collaboration, operating at LEP, the highest energy electron-positron collider,
              which is performing stringent tests of theoretical models; and the KTeV
              experiment, investigating the asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the
              universe.  This group has an exemplary education/diversity/outreach portfolio
              comprising five projects:  the Teachers Academy for Math and Science (TAMS);
              the Lecture Demonstration Spectacular, associated with the TAMS project; an REU
              activity that targets women and underrepresented minorities; participation in
              the Compton Lecture Program; and a new node in the Quarknet project, a
              web-based project involving high-school students and teachers working with
              particle physicists at Fermilab and CERN.
