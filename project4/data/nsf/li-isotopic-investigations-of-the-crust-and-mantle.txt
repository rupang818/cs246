Lithium, the lightest lithophile element, is fluid
              mobile.  The large mass difference between its two isotopes makes measurement
              of the Li isotopic ratio a powerful tool for tracing fluid processes in the
              Earth. This project will complete Li isotope investigations of peridotite and
              eclogite xenoliths from the mantle and sedimentary and granitic rocks from the
              continents.  The goal is to understand the role that fluid processes play in
              the growth of the continental lithosphere and to evaluate the inventory of Li
              isotopes in major solid Earth reservoirs in order to constrain Li isotope mass
              balance in the Earth system. The Li isotopic measurements will be performed
              using MC-ICP-MS methodology on solutions of rocks and minerals. The PIs have
              established this technique at Maryland and are routinely able to measure 40 ng
              or smaller Li fractions to plus or minus1 per mil precision (2 sigma). The
              newly acquired data sets will provide insights into the processes that control
              the Li isotopic composition of the crust and mantle, define the d7Li of
              potential contributors to subduction zone magmas and, ultimately, the influence
              of crustal recycling on d7Li of the mantle over time.
