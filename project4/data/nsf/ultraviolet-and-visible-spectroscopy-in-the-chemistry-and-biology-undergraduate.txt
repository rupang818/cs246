              Chemistry (12) Biological Sciences (61) 
The primary objectives for this
              project are to enhance the laboratory experience of students in ultraviolet and
              visible spectroscopy with the introduction of a new protein chemistry course,
              and to expand the laboratory experiences involving UV/visible spectroscopy in
              chemistry, biology, and molecular science courses. In addition, we are
              providing access of UV/visible spectroscopy to the wider educational community
              in Cedar Rapids through existing outreach programs. We are basing these changes
              on the addition of eight, single wavelength UV/visible spectrophotometers and
              three scanning UV/visible instruments. Students have the opportunity to use
              more sophisticated techniques with the inclusion of more research based
              laboratory experiences that begin in introductory laboratories and continue
              through advanced courses. The new protein chemistry course in being adapted
              from one developed by John Markwell at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln,
              while changes in the other courses include the adaptation of a wide range of
              experiments from the research or educational literature.
