Determination of the distributions of quarks and gluons inside
              of
the proton and there hadronic particles is one  f  the central topics in
              high energy nuclear and particle physics.  The form of these distributions
              impacts not only our understanding of the structure of the proton, but  lso
              affects the interpretation of experiments at higher energies which require
              these distributions as input.  The primary focus of this proposal is the
              calculation of the harge asymmetric contribution to the proton sea within a
              variety of distinct models of the nucleon sea.  A secondary focus of this
              proposal is the study of nuclear effects on quark distributions using
              phenomenological descriptions of light nuclei.  Such  nuclei are sufficiently
              tightly bound to exhibit significant nuclear modifications to their quark
              distributions and yet are simple enough to be modeled  phenomenologically.  We
              propose to apply models and methods that have previously been used to calculate
              the quark distributions of single nucleons to light nuclei in order to test the
              viability of these models as alternative explanations of the observed
              modification of quark distributions in nuclei.
