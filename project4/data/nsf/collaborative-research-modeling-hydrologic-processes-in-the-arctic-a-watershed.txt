              The project will modify an existing catchment-based Land Surface Model to
              include the effects of snow and freeze-thaw dynamics on Arctic tundra
              hydrology.  The development of this model will fill a gap in currently
              available models that do not incorporate the combined effects of snow physics,
              permafrost dynamics and topography on tundra hydrology.  The current deficiency
              has severely limited efforts aimed at understanding and predicting the effects
              of climate change on arctic ecosystems.  By addressing this problem this
              project will have a major impact on our understanding of the responsiveness of
              the Arctic to climate change.
