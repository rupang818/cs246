              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2002.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Multi-species sequence comparison and compositional analysis of plant
              centromeres."  This research seeks is to understand the composition,
              organization and evolution of centromeres--regions that mediate chromosome
              partitioning. Centromere sequences from relatives of the flowering plant
              Arabidopsis thaliana are being compared to assess sequence conservation and
              determine the types and abundance of sequence classes. This will distinguish
              rapidly evolving sequences from those exhibiting significant conservation.
