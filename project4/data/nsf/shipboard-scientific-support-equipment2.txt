This award will supply shipboard
              scientific support equipment for the research vessel  Cape Henlopen operated by
              the University of Delaware (UDEL) and dedicated to use in support of marine
              research.  The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds
              for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean
              science research. The Program provides support for such items as deck equipment
              including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific
              instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth
              satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites, communication
              equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and
              scientific data communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats
              for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.    The Project
              Director, Matthew Hawkins is fully qualified to direct this project having had
              considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of
              shipboard equipment.  This project will allow the institution to acquire a
              rigid inflatable boat through a group purchase made by LUMCON (no monetary
              award for UDEL).  UDEL will make a group purchase of communication equipment
              for 6 institutions.  Through this group purchase UDEL will acquire an
              integrated communications system. ***
