The PI proposes to investigate a wavelength interchanging
              cross-connect geared towards applications in the Next Generation Networks.  In
              particular, he will pursue a parametric wavelength interchanging cross-connect
              incorporating difference-frequency wavelength converters with integrated pump
              sources.  The resulting wavelength interchanging cross-connect has the
              following unique properties:


accommodates signals of any protocol and
              format,
crossconnects subcarrier multiplexed optical header and baseband data
              payload,
offers scalability of Benes architecture,
utilizes multichannel
              wavelength conversion for reduced architecture,
achieves polarization
              insensitivity and wavelength independent filtering.

The proposed effort
              makes comprehensive studies of the Wavelength Interchanging Cross-Connect
              covering architecture, simulation, design, fabrication and systems integration
              issues.  Specifically, he will pursue an integrated effort of the following
              research activities:

1. Wavelength Interchanging Cross-connect Architecture
              Studies, which will pursue a transparent and scalable architecture suited for
              Next Generation Network applications,
2. Wavelength Conversion Technology
              Studies, which will design, fabricate, and prototype wavelength converters
              supporting transparent multichannel wavelength conversion, and
3.
              Cross-connect Integration, which will bring space switches and wavelength
              converters together to form a wavelength interchanging cross-connect.  The
              designed architecture and network elements will be put to test at this step and
              the simulation results will be experimentally verified.
