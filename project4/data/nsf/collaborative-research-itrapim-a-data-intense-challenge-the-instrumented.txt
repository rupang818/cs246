Increasing production from existing oil and
              natural gas reservoirs is crucial for the US economy.  In order to better
              monitor and optimize oil and gas production, advanced technologies from field
              instrumentation to information technology and computational science are
              essential.  Field technologies include time-lapse surface and borehole seismic,
              permanent downhole sensors, intelligent well completions, fiber optics, and
              remote control operations.  IT technologies include data management, data
              visualization, parallel computing, and decision-making tools such as new wave
              propagation and multiphase, multi-component flow and transport computational
              portals.  These diverse technologies can be integrated to achieve real-time
              monitoring and optimization of reservoir production:  The Instrumented
              Oilfield.

A major outcome of the proposed research is a computing portal
              which will enable reservoir simulation and geophysical calculations to interact
              dynamically with the data and with each other and which will provide a variety
              of visual and quantitative tools.  Test data will be provided by oil and
              service companies currently participating in UT Austin industrial affiliate
              programs.  Since the proposed research is directed towards the general problem
              of modeling and characterization of the earth's subsurface, it has immediate
              application to other areas, including environmental remediation and storage of
              hazardous wastes.
