              The Geologic Data Center at SIO has multibeam bathymetry data for 241 cruises on
              three vessels. These data have been locally archived and used to create custom
              data products for the MGG community. In the future, the intention is to make
              all these data available on line to the community and much of the cost for
              doing this is provided by other support (other NSF directorates and programs).
              Under this award, the PIs will clean up the existing data (systematically make
              appropriate corrections, edit bad data, make consistent file names, etc..), and
               migrate all the data to a common medium- a robotic digital tape library that
              will be under the control of the Storage Resource Broker, an archive management
              product of the San Diego Supercomputer Center.
