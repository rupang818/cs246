              Ray tracing methods are an important tool in computational geophysics, and are
              used regularly both for simulating seismic wave propagation and for generating
              images of subsurface geologic structures in inversion and imaging methods. For
              example, these are some of the basic tools in oil exploration. However, even
              recent high-efficiency ray tracing implementations have some potentially
              important limitations. On the other hand, wavefront construction algorithms are
              another class of solutions that do compute all of the relevant physical
              information. This project will develop these methods. They will find use in a
              wide range of activities ranging from fundamental studies of the nature of the
              Earth's deep interior to analysis and characterization of oil reservoirs in the
              petroleum industry.

Technically, this project will develop new wavefront
              construction methods for seismic ray tracing in 3-D, anisotropic models of the
              Earth. This allows more general and realistic Earth models than are currently
              possible. At the same time, this is an important problem in advanced
              computational science, because the 3-D mesh constructed in the course of the
              simulation will have geometries and features not usually considered in other
              common mesh construction algorithms. Another important aspect of the research
              will be the development of self-tuning components in the software to allow the
              algorithm to automatically adapt itself for maximum computational speed on
              hardware configurations ranging from small desktop workstations to massively
              parallel supercomputers.
