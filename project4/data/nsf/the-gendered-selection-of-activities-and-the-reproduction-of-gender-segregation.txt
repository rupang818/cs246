	This
              project combines experimental and survey methods to assess a new analysis of
              how women and men come to occupy different occupational positions. The
              theoretical foundation uses ideas from status characteristics theory to explain
              women's and men's different conceptions of their competence (under specified
              conditions), and subsequent occupational aspiration. Predictions from this
              theory will be tested in a small groups laboratory. The second part of the
              study examines survey data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of
              high school students for evidence of the same processes as the experimental
              research finds. Results will be important for extending an established theory
              in micro-sociology, as well as for showing some real-world applications of the
              theoretical principles developed.
