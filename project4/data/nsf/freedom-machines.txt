              Freedom Machines is a one-hour special for public television which will
              highlight the information about the newest technological advances which support
              over 54 million Americans with disabilities.  Through personal narratives,
              high-impact storytelling, and a comprehensive public education and outreach
              campaign, the show will inform viewers about assistive technology (AT) being
              used, and how it is adapted and designed by people with disabilities.  The
              individuals to be profiled, many of them leaders in science and technological
              fields, will encourage young people with disabilities to pursue careers in the
              sciences.  Many of the devices and approaches to be featured will also show how
              valuable these technologies are for the able bodied, general public.

The
              sixty-minute documentary is structured around the themes of Pioneers, Partners
              and Prophets in order to examine the evolving relationship between technology
              and the disabled, profile emerging technologies and explore the larger societal
              implications of this growing phenomenon.  A companion website and extensive
              outreach program will continue the informative material, support and create
              networks, and promote linkages between viewers, either abled or disabled, and
              the technology that might benefit them.  Technological changes have always been
              influenced by people with needs beyond the ordinary.  This dynamic is even more
              relevant in today's information age.  Freedom Machines will dramatically
              demonstrate that designing a world of inclusion benefits everyone.
