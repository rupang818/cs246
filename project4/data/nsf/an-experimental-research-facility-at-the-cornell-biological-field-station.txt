              This award provides funds to help in construction of a multi-user experimental
              research facility (pole barn) at the Cornell Biological Field Station (CBFS) on
              Oneida Lake.  The facility will be outfitted with access to low pressure
              aeration, drains, ground fault electrical service, controlled temperature,
              natural and artificial light, natural diurnal light and temperature,
              experimental tanks (differing in size and volume), and walk-in environmental
              chambers. The new tanks will permit a range of experiments in biogeochemistry,
              fish bioenergetics, nutrient dynamics, and land-water interactions.

The CBFS
              research program includes long-term studies of Oneida Lake, a focus on large
              lake limnology, and the training of graduate and undergraduate students in
              field research.  Understanding the mechanisms driving the long-term patterns
              documented for Oneida Lake can frequently be approached in experiments
              conducted in relatively small-scale facilities, where controls and suitable
              replicates can be employed. Historically, CBFS has had a strong field
              orientation and this award will provide the station with the capability to
              adequately test mechanisms hypothesized from field observations.
