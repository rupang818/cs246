The 2000 Gordon Research on Membranes:
              Materials and Processes

Abstract


This award supports partially the
              participation by invited speakers and discussion leaders from academic
              institutions at the Gordon Conference on Membranes to be held in New London,
              NH, from August 4 to August 9, 2002.  The sessions scheduled for this year's
              conference include polymer membranes, inorganic membranes, fuel-cell membranes,
              mixed-media membranes, and biomedical applications as well as
              industry-university-government and international collaborations in the field.  
              In each session there will be two or three invited speakers.  Poster sessions
              are also planned.

The Gordon Conferences are kept small and are structured
              to give the participants considerable time for discussion and interaction. 
              They provide a vehicle for communication between research groups, which will be
              represented here by researchers not only from U.S. universities but also from
              industry and universities in Europe and Japan.  This grant is specifically
              targeted to permit attendance by twenty advanced-level graduate students and
              post-docs at the conference.
