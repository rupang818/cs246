This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of
              California Santa Cruz will provide support for acquisition of a genetic
              analyzer for DNA sequencing, liquid handling robotics, computer workstations
              and software for DNA analysis, and technical support for the Molecular Ecology
              and Evolutionary Genetics facility.  It is expected that the new
              instrumentation and the interdepartmental research and training facility will
              foster interdisciplinary approaches to a broad range of problems in marine and
              terrestrial ecology and evolutionary biology.  UCSC will contribute
              cost-sharing of more than 30% of the cost of this project from non-federal
              funds.
