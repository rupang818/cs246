Funding is providing to support a workshop on shallow
              tropical-subtropical overturning cells (STC) and their interaction with the
              atmosphere. The goal of the workshop is to assess the present understanding of
              the structure and dynamics of the shallow tropical-subtropical overturning
              cells in the tropics and develop strategies for future observational and
              modeling studies. Through their effects on sea surface temperature the STC's
              have been proposed as the oceanic component of coupled modes of air-sea
              variability that influence the atmospheric climate on decadal time scales. 
              Physical oceanographers and meteorologists will participate in the workshop.
              The funds requested from NSF will support travel expenses for graduate
              students, young scientists and some needy invited speakers and program
              committee members. This workshop will be a contribution to the CLImate
              VARiability and predictability (CLIVAR) program.
