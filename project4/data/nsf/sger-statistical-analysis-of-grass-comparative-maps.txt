              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project focuses on
              computational and statistical methods to evaluate comparative genetic map data.
              Two new statistical approaches, the colinearity test and the genome matrix,
              will be explored and developed further. Both methods will be applied to an
              existing biological problem that needs reassessment - the comparative map of
              the grasses.  Both methods will be implemented in computer programs that will
              be released to the scientific community. Eventually, these methods will prove
              useful not only for interpreting comparative genetic map data but also for
              interpreting physical map and comparative sequence data.
