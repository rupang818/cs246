The aim of this theoretical research is to contribute to the
              construction of fundamental devices in quantum information processing and
              computation, and in spin-enhanced optoelectronics.  The research is planned on
              the theory of the basic physical processes involved in the realization of the
              quantum algorithms by means of laser manipulation of electrons and their spin
              degress of freedom in semiconductor nanostructures.  A photon in the laser beam
              can excite an electron in a semiconductor nano-dot into a state known as an
              exciton.  The circular polarization of the light can also give the exciton a
              specific spin.  Here, the spin-polarized exciton is selected as the phsyical
              representation of the fundamental unit of quantum information, the qubit. 
              Optical control of a single exciton addresses the qubit and optical control of
              two interacting excitons yields the operation of a quantum logic device.  The
              research consists of (1) a computation of the energy structures of the
              multiexciton states; (2) a theory of the nonlinear optical spectra of the
              quantum dot under intense laser excitation as a diagnostic tool for the
              conditions of operations; (3) design of the optical processes for the
              operations of the basic devices; (4) a study of the environmental degradation
              of the quantum nature of the exciton (decoherence); and  (5) test of the design
              by numerical simulations of the time series of operations to accomplish simple
              versions of key quantum algorithms.
