This project will carry out a 3D crustal
              structure study making use of the excellent data set recovered from the 1999
              Chi-Chi (Taiwan) mainshock and several of its large aftershocks, plus three
              year worth of seismic background strong-motion recordings of several hundreds
              smaller (M ~4 - 5) events.  These events are recorded by (1) a complement of
              700 freefield digital strong-motion stations, (2) 75 3-componeent short-period
              network stations and (3) 12 broadband stations.  The investigators will use the
              above data set to study a large sedimentation basin in southwestern Taiwan,
              with the objective to deduce a 3D crustal structure of resolution up to 3 s
              period.  The upper crustal structure will be determined by a standard array
              processing technique using 1D surface-wave phase velocity inversion analysis
              for the period range 3 - 15 s.  Lower crustal structure can be determined by
              dispersion data of long-period (10 s - 100 s) surface waves recorded at an
              array of broadband stations.  A group of adjacent 1D crustal models will be
              pieced together to obtain a 3D crustal structure.
