ABSTRACT 
Despite large-scale explorations of connections
              between water quality and bedrock weathering, large gaps in our understanding
              of these relationships remain.  Contaminants, such as metals extracted from
              soft sedimentary rocks such as black shales, are released to rivers and
              groundwaters and subsequently are transported to water supplies. While it is
              clear that black shales contribute to the metal budgets we lack the basic
              information necessary to gauge the impact of black shale weathering on water
              and sediment quality.  This study will explore the geochemical behavior of
              metals during black shale weathering in several catchments (three underlain by
              black shales, one underlain by limestone and the fifth impacted by agricultural
              activity).  Data collection will integrate several disciplines including
              geochemistry, mineralogy, hydrology and ecotoxicology.  Physical and chemical
              hydrologic data, metal chemistry of environmental media (precipitation, surface
              water, groundwater, soil, stream sediments etc.) and bioassay and
              sediment-water quality testing will be integrated over an 18 month collection
              period.  These data, when considered in concert, are critical to assessing
              metal loading in black shale regions and the impact of metal release on aquatic
              ecosystems.
