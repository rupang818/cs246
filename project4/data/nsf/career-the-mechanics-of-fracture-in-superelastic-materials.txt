Shape
              memory alloys (SMA) constitute a unique class of materials that have
already
              proven to have wide-ranging applications in the biomedical,
aerospace,
              microelectronics, and automotive industries. These materials
have a
              crystallographic structure that can change reversibly and
reproducibly,
              allowing the material to display dramatic stress-induced
              and
temperature-induced recoverable deformations.  One key hurdle to their
              use
is the development of reliable SMA materials and structures, in which
              the
material's microstructure is well understood and its resistance to
              fatigue
and fracture can be reliably predicted.  Critical topics to be
              investigated
in this research involve:  determining the effect of
              process-induced
microstructure on fracture and fatigue behavior; exploring the
              effect of
grain refinement on the fracture behavior for grain sizes ranging
              between
the micron and nanometer scale; and developing experimentally-based
              models
that delineate the mechanisms influencing fracture and fatigue in NiTi
              and
Cu-based SMAs.  In conjunction with this research, education
              initiatives
will be undertaken to develop widespread training at the
              undergraduate and
graduate levels in superelastic behavior and shape memory
              materials, via
new course material in the areas of nanomaterials,
              micromechanics and
fracture mechanics. Not only will the expanded course
              material provide
students with an introduction to topics where mechanics has
              been developing
influence and making critical contributions to new
              technologies, it will
also have international impact via Smart Materials
