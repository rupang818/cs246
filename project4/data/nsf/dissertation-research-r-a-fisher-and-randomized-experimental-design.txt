              Sir Ronald A. Fisher (1890-1962) is most widely known for his contributions to
              statistics, including the analysis of variance, and for his work in genetics,
              especially his genetical theory of natural selection. Less well known is his
              major contribution to experimentation, the role of randomization in
              experimental design.  This dissertation research project will explore Fisher's
              actual development of the concept of experimental randomizing, how he conceived
              it and what led him to recognize the need for it. The second part of this
              project is an examination of Fisher's promulgation of randomization, the impact
              it had then and in later years, and the ways in which Fisher answered his
              critics, some of whom viewed randomization as unnecessary. Of special interest
              are the "volunteer workers" who came to Rothamsted Agricultural Station in
              England to work with Fisher and who stayed for periods of from three weeks to
              three years. These visitors, many of them international, returned to their
              respective countries and institutions carrying Fisher's methods of experimental
              design with them. Within two decades, randomized experimental design as first
              put forth by Fisher came to be not only accepted but also required in many
              areas of research.
