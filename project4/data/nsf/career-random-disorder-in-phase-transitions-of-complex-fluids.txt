              This project aims to study the nature of  ordering (or disordering) interactions
              occuring at the interface between liquid crystals and polymeric surfaces. It
              will involve a systematic survey of modified phase transitions of liquid
              crystals and mesogenic polymers to understand the influence of the
              perturbations caused by the non-mesogenic material in the form of  confining
              porous media or as colloidal dispersions. The role of topology or randomness
              connected with these perturbations will be studied, and the influence of
              randomness and boundary conditions with induced elastic deformation will be
              addressed. Given the experimental challenges of this project, new spectroscopic
              tools needed to advance calorimetric techniques necessary for studying the wide
              range of systems under investigation will be developed. 

Liquid crystal
              materials are important to practical applications areas that include optical
              displays and switches for communications, and biomedical areas such as the
              development of  new materials classes for drug delivery. Students trained in
              these areas are likely to be highly competitive in future job markets.
