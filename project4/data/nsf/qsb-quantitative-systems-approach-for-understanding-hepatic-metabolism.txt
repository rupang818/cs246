              The overall goal of this project is to integrate quantitative analysis with
              biology to provide a systems approach to understanding hepatocyte (liver)
              metabolism in order to gain insights into Type II diabetes. The specific goals
              of the project are to: (1) characterize a comprehensive set of metabolic
              alterations in the hepatocytes induced by environmental factors with the aid of
              metabolic flux analysis, (2) incorporate physiochemical information; namely,
              kinetic binding data to provide a mechanistic insight into hepatic metabolism
              beyond that obtained with metabolic flux analysis alone, and (3) develop a
              phenomenological model using multivariate analysis to identify candidate
              pathways or factors that contribute most to the diabetic phenotype.  The
              objective is the development of a model capable of identifying the potential
              for diabetes.
