Nussbaum

This two-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in
              computational mathematics and control theory involves Roger Nussbaum of Rutgers
              University, Sophie Bismuth of Leonardo Da Vinci University in Paris, Marianne
              Akian and Pierre-Alexandre Bliman of the French National Institute for Research
              in Computer Science and Engineering (INRIA) in Rocquencourt, France. The
              research collaboration is aimed at problems in control of oscillations.  
              Certain nonlinear differential delay equations demonstrate oscillatory and even
              periodic behavior.  Numerous examples of such systems may be found in biology,
              chemistry and mechanics.  The investigators propose to consider problems
              related to analysis and synthesis of multi-dimensional systems with delays and
              relays.
 
This award represents the U.S. side of a joint proposal to the NSF
              and the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and
              Engineering (INRIA).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses of the
              U.S. investigator.  INRIA will support the French researchers' visits to the
              United States.  The US investigators are expert in differential delay
              equations.  This is complemented by French expertise in nonlinear control
              systems and behavior of systems with delays and period oscillations.  The
              project will advance our understanding of the use of differential delay
              equations in industrial applications, for example, in controlling fuel/air
              ratios in internal combustion engines.
