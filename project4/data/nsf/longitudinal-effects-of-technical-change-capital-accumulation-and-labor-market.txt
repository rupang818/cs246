              This research uses household data to study how technical change in agriculture
              affects rates of tropical deforestation. Data come from surveys conducted in
              the Philippines over the period 1995-2001.  The timing and coverage of the data
              provide an opportunity to study the direct and indirect
effects of irrigation
              on agricultural production and labor allocation, while controlling for a number
              of agronomic features of the sample farms and important social factors such as
              tenure security. It is also possible to trace the causal chain of impacts
              leading from technology changes to changes
in employment, incomes, and
              activities undertaken by households living along the forest margin. 
      
              The analysis links three bodies of economic theory regarding agricultural
              development, labor market dynamics, and environmental management. Specific
              objectives include (1) assessing labor hiring and labor selling decisions in a
              dynamic context and their implications for capital formation, subsequent factor
              use, labor market participation, and forest pressure; (2) identifying the
              importance of transaction and supervision costs, as well as tenure security and
              site-specific factor productivity, for labor hiring and selling decisions; and
              (3) testing and correcting for attrition bias in the sample, especially as
              influenced by tenure security and factor productivity. Results will provide an
              empirical foundation for assessing competing theories regarding poverty and the
              environment, and will also inform broader debates regarding the distributional
              effects of growth and development and their implications for important aspects
              of household behavior. Results should have implications for a range of social
              and environmental outcomes including economic development, poverty reduction,
              biodiversity protection and carbon sequestration.
