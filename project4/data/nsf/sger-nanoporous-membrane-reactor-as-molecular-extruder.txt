This research involves the development of a
              nanomembrane reactor as a molecular extruder for efficient production of
              chemicals.  The reactor contains an inorganic membrane with catalytically
              active straight nanopores, and can be considered as a bundle of nano-sized
              reactor tubes.  By adjusting the nanopore dimensions, selecting an appropriate
              active coating species, and optimizing the reaction conditions, the PI can
              manipulate the reaction mechanism or path for synthesis of molecules at high
              yield or with special properties, unattainable by the conventional
              technologies.  The research is aimed at demonstrating the synthesis methodology
              of the straight-nanopore membranes and the technical feasibility of the
              membrane reactor concept incorporating them, for the production of polyethylene
              nanofibers.

For this initial exploratory phase, alumina-silica membranes
              with straight pores of 3-5 nm diameter and 10-100 mm in length will be tested. 
              They will be constructed by modifying straight Anopore alumina membranes by
              atomic layer chemical vapor deposition of silica.  The internal pore surfaces
              of the nanopores will be modified by a metallocene catalyst.  The reactor will
              be tested by using it to synthesize polyethylene nanofibers with polymer chains
              oriented in one direction.
