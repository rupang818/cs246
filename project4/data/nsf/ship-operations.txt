San Jose State University Foundation (Moss Landing Marine
              Laboratories- MLML) will operate the R/V Point Sur during 2000 as a general
              oceanographic research vessel in support of NSF-supported research projects. 
              The Point Sur is a 135 ft. vessel, constructed in 1981, and owned by NSF and
              operated by MLML.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 162 operational days
              during 2000, of which 65 days are in support of NSF-supported investigators. 
              The remaining cruises will support Navy, USCOE, NOPP, and other Federal and
              private projects.  The projects scheduled on the Point Sur represent several
              oceanographic disciplines, including physical and biological oceanography,
              geology, ichthyology, benthic ecology and marine mammal behavior, and will
              fully utilize the capabilities of the vessel. The vessel will be used for a
              variety of projects such as maintaining moored arrays, providing a platform for
              instructional training and curriculum support, and supporting collaborative
              interagency research. Operations will take place regionally around Moss
              Landing.

The Point Sur is part of a fleet of ships used by the National
              Science Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most oceanographic
              projects require highly specialized equipment to be permanently installed on
              the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized ships.  These vessels do not
              operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF
              supports the operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated to
              oceanographic research that are operated by universities and institutions
              around the country.
