              Professor Carol Korzeniewski of Texas Tech University is funded by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study oxidation pathways of
              methanol and related small molecules on electrodes, which constitute
              fundamental steps in fuel cells.  Bulk and graphite-supported nanoparticles
              that contain platinum and platinum-group metals will serve as substrates.  The
              reactions will be studied by vibrational spectroscopy, scanning force
              microscopy and Monte Carlo simulations.  The objective is to identify steps
              that limit current flow, an understanding of which can help to improve electric
              power generation.  Different molecular behaviors are observed on bulk and
              nanoparticle materials.  This research could lead to a molecular understanding
              of this paradox.

Fuel cells are an exciting growing technology based on an
              electrochemical device that combines hydrogen fuel and oxygen from the air to
              produce electricity, heat and water. Fuel cells operate without combustion, so
              they are virtually pollution free.  Research is needed to overcome some of the
              problems and to further develop this technology.
