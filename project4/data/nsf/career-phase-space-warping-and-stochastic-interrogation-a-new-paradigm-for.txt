              This CAREER educational and research project seeks to study the dynamical and
              stochastic theories for damage evolution in phase space and to develop
              prognostic capability for machinery and structural health monitoring systems.
              The main goal of the research is to develop methods capable of tracking
              simultaneously occurring multiple damage processes and accurately predicting
              imminent failures in variable forcing conditions. Applications to complex
              systems including composite structures will be investigated.

The proposed
              educational activities include the introduction of M&SHM related science &
              technology content into the curriculum. Collaborative effort to outreach with
              on-going programs at the Rhode Island University will be carried out.
