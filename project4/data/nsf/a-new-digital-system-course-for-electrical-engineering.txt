              Engineering - Electrical (55)

This project investigates a shift in the
              introductory digital systems course from the current focus on gate level design
              to a HDL (hardware description language), register-transfer level focus. The
              emphasis is placed on the fundamentals of current design methodologies and
              skills to utilize the latest high-density programmable devices and synthesis
              software tools. The PI is developing a textbook, a set of experiments, and a
              web site to provide a detailed coverage of the concepts, principles, and
              practices of register-transfer level design. Student surveys provide feedback
              on the content, organization, continuity of topics, and level of difficulty.
              Course instructors in the senior design course will assess the students'
              digital circuit design abilities and compare them to those of earlier students
              who had a traditional digital systems course. The PI is planning to present
              papers at education-oriented conferences, to prepare manuscripts for education
              journals, and to post complete lecture slide, class projects, and laboratory
              experiments on his web site to supplement the material in the developed
              textbook.
