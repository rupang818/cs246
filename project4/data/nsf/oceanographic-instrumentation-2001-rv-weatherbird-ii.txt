This award to Bermuda Biological Station for Research provides
              instrumentation to expand the oceanographic research capabilities of the
              research vessel Weatherbird II, a ship operated by BBSR as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. 
              The CTD sensors and pylon provide critical backup systems, and the new
              meteorological instruments provide a more cost-effective alternative to the
              existing suite of sensors on the vessel.  In addition, we support preparation
              of a well in the vessel that can in future be used for installation of an
              acoustic doppler current profiler, although funds to acquire that instrument
              are not provided at this time. These improvements will be of substantial
              advantage to marine scientists using the ship in their research during 2001 and
              future years.
