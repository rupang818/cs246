              This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project will
              develop a fully functional, cost-effective, prototype sensor for carbon
              monoxide and volatile organic contaminants in air.  Phase I results suggest
              that a sensor array based on catalyst-doped, nano-crystalline metal oxide films
              will provide a marked improvement in detection of contaminants, such as
              formaldehyde, and thereby upgrade control of indoor air quality.  Phase II will
              develop this sensor technology with objectives of long-term use, low cost, high
              sensitivity, and sufficient selectivity for commercial applications.

These
              applications include indoor air quality monitoring, environmental air
              monitoring, oil refining, chemical manufacturing, automotive emission control
              systems, and industrial process
