The mesozoic and tertiary accretion and
              transport history of terranes along the western plate margin of North America
              has received considerable study, however work to date has been unable to
              resolve between the two major hypotheses that have emerged.  These models
              differ mainly in the timing of accretion and particularly in the subsequent
              northward terrane translation along the continental margin.  This project will
              take a new tack and focus on a innovative detrital provenance analysis of basin
              sediments that were deposited along the margin during this time period is the
              hopes of pinning the source terranes and therefore the locations of terranes at
              various times.  Results should help break the impasse in understanding the
              tectonic history of terrane accretion along the pacific margin of North America
              during mesozoic and tertiary time.
