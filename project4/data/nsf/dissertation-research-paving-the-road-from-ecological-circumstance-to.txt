              Abstract
Defensive mimicry systems are typically categorized into two types:
              Batesian, involving a defenseless mimic and a defended model, or Mullerian,
              involving two or more defended co-models.  More recent theoretical treatments
              of mimicry predict that the nature of a single mimicry system may vary over
              space and time.  In this proposal, the work incorporates both the phenology and
              the geography of three butterfly species to assess the dynamics of two
              well-known mimicry systems: the viceroy/monarch system and the viceroy/queen.
              While these systems were originally classified as Batesian mimicry,
              accumulating evidence suggests that the viceroy is often unpalatable to avian
              predators, while the models, the monarch and queen, can often be palatable.
              Thus, the viceroy mimicry complex may span the continuum with roles of model
              and mimic changing through space and time. This work will document the
              chemistry responsible for unpalatability, spatial and temporal variation in
              chemical defense of the three butterfly species, and variation in palatability
              to vertebrate and invertebrate predators.
