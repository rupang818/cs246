MRI: Multisensory Human Interaction
              Measurement and Synthesis for Computer Graphics and Interactive Virtual
              Environments 

This proposal, measuring multisensory human interaction with
              everyday objects and with other humans, develops an integrated facility in
              which it will be possible to acquire synchronized measurements of visual,
              auditory, and haptic behavior with low latency. The work includes measuring
              motion at up to 250Hz using a marker-based motion capture system, acquiring
              dense range images, recording speech and contact sounds, and measuring forces
              and pressure distributions due to human contact. The facility will make a broad
              range of research activity possible. Multisensory models of objects will be
              developed; it will then be possible not only to see images of a virtual object,
              but to feel its stiffness and surface texture using a force feedback haptic
              device, and to hear its sound when hit. Multisensory models of human
              conversational behavior will be developed by tracking lip and arm movements at
              the same time as recording voice. "Interaction capture" will extend motion
              capture, the current state of the art for realistic computer animation. Hence,
              it will be possible to not only transfer and transform the motion of an
              animated character, but also the forces and sounds produced when the character
              interacts with the world. Moreover, the computing infrastructure needed to
              support interaction will be investigated. Multisensory interaction imposes new
              constraints on system behavior, particularly latency, and could lead to new
              designs of computer operating systems and communication networks. The
              instrumentation will enable more students to be educated about multisensory
              simulation and interaction, and to use multisensory environments in new ways to
              stimulate learning and discovery. Funds are requested for
1. Sensor systems
              for interaction and measurement,
2. Acoustical environment of experiment,
3.
              Audiovisual displays, and
4. Computing.
