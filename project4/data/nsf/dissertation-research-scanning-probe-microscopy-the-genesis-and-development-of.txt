              In the twenty years since researchers at IBM Zurich introduced the scanning
              tunneling microscope (STM) to the world, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has
              become one of the most valuable tools available to physicists, chemists,
              electrical engineers, materials scientists, biologists, and others seeking to
              understand the nanoscale features of surfaces. The rich history of SPMs, rooted
              in the technologies of postwar surface science, has become steadily more
              diverse as an alphabet soup of instruments and techniques, beginning with the
              atomic force microscope (AFM) and the scanning capacitance microscope (SCaM),
              has arisen for measuring and picturing a wide variety of material properties at
              very high resolution. This dissertation research project seeks to record the
              history of the development of these laboratory artifacts, and the practices
              surrounding them, as well as to contribute an ethnographic understanding of how
              SPMs are used in the ordinary conduct of laboratory life. The project therefore
              has two parts: an historical component, involving documentary research and
              interviews with most of the principals in the development of SPMs; and an
              ethnographic component, involving participant-observation with groups of
              materials scientists who currently use various SPMs. Each component will shed
              light on, and raise questions for, the other.
