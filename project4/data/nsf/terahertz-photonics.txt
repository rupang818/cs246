              The primary aim of this proposal is the development of diffractive
              photonic
components for the terahertz spectral range, and the exploration of
              terahertz
pulse propagation in strongly diffractive media.  One primary aim of
              this
proposal is to develop a range of new and useful optical components
              specifically
designed for the far infrared, or terahertz, spectral range,
              based on the
concepts of photonic crystals.  Researchers have made tremendous
              strides in the
use of periodically diffractive materials for optical
              components, with examples
ranging from fiber Bragg gratings to colloidal
              crystal notch filters.  Such
systems could also be useful as waveguides,
              filters, tunable dispersive optics,
and as components for wavelength division
              multiplexing (WDM).  However, these
ideas have rarely been implemented at
              terahertz frequencies, a portion of the
spectrum with increasing technological
              importance.  Another important aspect of
the proposed research involves the
              propagation of THz radiation in strongly
scattering media.  This area of
              research has been of substantial interest in
recent years, motivated by the
              prospect of achieving localization of
electromagnetic waves.  Interestingly,
              although a clear demonstration of light
localization is quite difficult in the
              optical regime, this research has led to
the development of techniques for
              imaging in turbid media.  Since many of the
expected applications of THz
              imaging involve turbid or scattering media, it will
be valuable to extend
              these imaging studies to the THz regime
