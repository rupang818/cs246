Few detailed records of the high-resolution variations in
              climate regimes that likely accompanied the evolution of Pangean monsoonal
              circulation during the Permian exist.  Moreover, geologic climate indicators
              and numeric models for Pangea suggest that megamonsoon development was
              accompanied by increased global warming possibly brought on by increased pCO2
              levels in Permian atmospheres.  Paleosols are a sensitive source of
              paleoenvironmental and paleoclimate information by offering multiple proxies of
              paleohydrology, precipitation levels, and seasonality that collectively reflect
              regional paleoclimatic conditions.  In addition, pedogenic carbonates in the
              same paleosols can provide a direct record of paleo-pCO2 and associated changes
              in global temperature that is independent from the record provided by other
              paleosol proxies.  Our collaborative research team proposes to define the first
              detailed paleoclimate reconstruction and paleo-pCO2 record for western
              equatorial Pangea by carrying out an integrated sedimentologic, petrologic,
              geochemical, magnetostratigraphic, and geochronologic analysis of Permian
              paleosols in the terrestrial successions of Texas and Oklahoma.

This
              research is directed by three main objectives:  (1) to carry out a
              comprehensive field and laboratory study of paleosols in order to identify
              those sedimentologic, mineralogic, geochemical, and biologic proxies that most
              accurately record temporal changes in regional climate.  (2) To reconstruct the
              evolution of atmospheric pCO2 throughout Permian time by carrying out a stable
              isotope analysis of pedogenic carbonates and associated vertebrate tooth
              enamel, as well as compound-specific stable isotope analysis of terrestrial
              organic matter from the same paleosols.  (3) To develop a significantly
              improved temporal framework for calibration of the detailed paleoclimate and
              paleo-pCO2 records by applying the following techniques to the Texas and
              Oklahoma terrestrial successions: a) 40Ar/39Ar dating of volcanic sanidines,
              pedogenic Fe-sulfates (natrojarosite), and evaporitic minerals (langbeinite),
              b) U-Pb dating of pedogenic carbonates, c) Rb-Sr dating of Mg-rich authigenic
              clays encapsulated within evaporites, and d) detailed magnetostratigraphic
              study of the Late Permian terrestrial successions.

The resulting
              paleoclimate and paleo-pCO2 records should (1) provide significantly enhanced
              temporal constraints on megamonsoon development and associated evolution of the
              climate system, (2) contribute toward constraining the timing of deglaciation
              that would have been brought on by increased atmospheric pCO2 levels, (3)
              provide detailed and calibrated paleoclimate/paleo-pCO2 records for testing and
              constraining numeric model results, (4) greatly facilitate the correlation of
              our terrestrial records to climate records derived from other terrestrial
              deposits as well as to marine paleoclimate records, and (5) 'set the stage' for
              better understanding the paleoenvironmental stresses that may have contributed
              to the massive end-Permian extinction.
