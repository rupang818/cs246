              This project addresses the need to produce a highly skilled, technically
              competent workforce to meet the technological, communication, and teamwork
              requirements that local, regional, national, and global economies are
              demanding. The objective is to complete the final 39 modules of a curriculum
              begun in 1995 that will be a model modularized curriculum for the Associate in
              Applied Science degree in Manufacturing Engineering Technology. The advantage
              of the modular structure is that students benefit from learning by hands-on
              experience, solving problems, using communication skills, and practicing
              teamwork as they learn technical skills. Activities focus on creating and pilot
              testing modules in nine cluster areas-Science; Math; Humanities, Communication,
              and Teamwork; and six manufacturing oriented clusters. To develop the modules
              and reach the target audiences, Sinclair Community College, a public two-year
              college in Dayton, Ohio, is partnering with the University of Dayton, a
              private, four-year institution.
