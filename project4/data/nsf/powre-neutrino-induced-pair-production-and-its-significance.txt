              This POWRE award provides funding that would allow the PI to expand her research
              activity with various national programs and collaborations at a critical time
              in her career.  This project is aimed at investigating neutrino induced
              electron-positron production and its astrophysical and laboratory significance.
               The outcomes of the project research may advance knowledge on the dynamics and
              physics of photon and W/Z coupled neutrino- nucleus processes and their impact
              on stellar and laboratory neutrino research.  The award is funded by the NSF
              POWRE program, the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the MPS
              Directorate, and the Physics Division.
