              The topic of proposed work is development of robust algorithms for vision-based
              mobile robot navigation. A probabilistic framework is proposed for reliable
              navigation between landmarks in an unmodeled environment. In the considered
              strategy, the robot first explores its environment to learn the landmarks, and
              then uses the graph produced in the process for navigation.
