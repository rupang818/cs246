              Mate choice affects many aspects of male and female behavior across different
              species.  Information on female mate searching by females is an important but
              little studied part of this process.  The proposed study uses information
              gained from long-term observation of mating and mate searching of bowerbirds to
              test novel hypotheses about 1) the rules for mate searching, 2) how searching
              is affected by past female experience, and 3) how female searching behavior
              affects male display strategies, reproductive skews and lifetime male
              reproductive success.  The proposed work will provide previously unavailable
              information on lifetime records of mate searching and mating for both sexes. 
              Satin bowerbirds are an excellent model for such studies because female
              visitation can be monitored with cameras that provide time and date information
              that allows mate searching patterns to be reconstructed.

Mate choice is a
              fundamental process that affects nearly all animals. There are many questions
              about the process of mate choice that are unresolved.  Studies of mate choice
              are valuable because they are useful in constructing a general theory of
              choice.  Such a theory is useful in understanding mating behavior and the
              genetics and conservation of natural populations.
