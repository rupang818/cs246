              Fifteen students majoring in computer science or software engineering are
              receiving scholarships annually. These academically-talented students are
              financially needy and the scholarships are allowing them to undertake fulltime
              study. The university in cooperation with local business and industry is
              providing internship and cooperative work experiences, career guidance and
              opportunities, reviews of software projects and honors theses, and classroom
              discussion regarding real world practices. These activities are 
improving the
              academic and professional performance of the scholars and increasing the number
              of students continuing on to graduate school.
