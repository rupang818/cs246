              The method of optimal prediction has been developed recently.
It gives the best
              approximation to non-linear equations
assuming that the higher modes are
              random.
It is suited for computing complicated flows, when
the information
              about the initial data is incomplete.
The proposer will study the convergence
              of the optimal prediction method
applied to the cubic Schrodinger
              equation.
Such equations occur in quantum mechanics.
In addition the method
              will be used to study the flow
of incompressible and inviscid fluids in three
              dimensions.
The complicated behavior of such fluids is part of the
problem of
              turbulence.

Turbulent flows typically consist of a slow, large scale
              motion,
and a lot of small, but fast, eddies. Instead of computing the
              flow
by a single numerical algorithm, the investigator will treat
the small
              scale motion as a random component, and incorporate
its influence on the large
              scale motion approximately. The goal
is to develope faster and more robust
              computational schemes
for turbulent flows.
