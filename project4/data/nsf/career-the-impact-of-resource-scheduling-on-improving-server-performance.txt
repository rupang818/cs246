              This proposal tackles fundamental problems in system design using a two-pronged
              approach including both queueing theory and kernel-level implementation. 
              Particular emphasis is placed on understanding the impact of heavy-tailed
              properties in compute workloads.  The proposal
focuses on two specific
              research questions:

(1) Is it possible to reduce the expected response time
              of every request at a server, simply by changing the order in which requests
              are scheduled?  Todays web servers employ FAIR scheduling, wherein requests are
              time-shared fairly.  This proposal considers instead
scheduling which biases
              towards SHORT requests, and argues analytically and via implementation that
              biasing towards SHORT requests improves response times for all requests.

(2)
              How should servers be designed to cope with transient overload conditions? 
              Most of client dissatisfaction can be attributed to moments of temporary
              overload at the server.  This proposal aims to  understand exactly what happens
              to systems during overload, both via a formal queueing analysis and via a
              rigorous systematic study of server/OS internals.
