This three-year award will provide support for Jose
              Menendez of Arizona State University to work with Jose Calleja at the
              Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain.  The primary goal of their research is
              to perform inelastic light scattering studies of carbon nanotubes under high
              magnetic fields, in the expectation of characterizing nanotube samples, which
              always contain a heterogeneous distribution of nanotube sizes and structures. 
              In addition, they plan to investigate some unusual magnetic field effects -
              ranging from a metal-insulator transition to an enhancement of the predicted
              Peierls distortion in 1D-metals -- that have been predicted
              theoretically.

The two laboratories are complementary.  The US laboratory is
              equipped with Raman instrumentation with extremely high resolution and
              contrast.  The Spanish laboratory is one of the few in the world where Raman
              measurements with fields as high as 12T and temperatures as low as 0.3 K can be
              performed routinely.  Carbon nanotubes have been proposed as the ideal tip
              materials for scanning probe microscopies, as an alternative to composite
