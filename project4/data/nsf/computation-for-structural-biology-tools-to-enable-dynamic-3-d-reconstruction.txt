A key
              challenge in computational structural biology is the determination of the 3-D
              structure of a virus, and
especially dynamical changes in 3-D structure which
              are central to understanding the function of the virus.  This information is
              central to rational design of drugs to combat viral infections and to the use
              of viruses for other purposes, e.g., as vehicles for the targeted delivery of
              drugs to specific organs.  Solving these problems involves the development,
              analysis, implementation and use of new algorithms for two numerical
              computation problems, global optimization and multidimensional
              quadrature.

The investigators compute a 3-D structure by locating the global
              minimum of a cost which is a function of experimental data and of a predictor,
              and which quantitates the difference between the data and the prediction of the
              data.  The predictor, whose evaluation requires multidimensional quadrature, is
              a function of parameters describing the 3-D structure of the virus and any
              unknown aspects of the data collection process and the minimization is with
              respect to these parameters.  Performance of the approach is limited by
the
              global optimization and quadrature tools and therefore these tools are the foci
              of this research.  Key global
optimization issues are exploiting the
              multi-scale structure of the data and parameters in the cost due to the
              presence of Fourier transforms and the tradeoff between accuracy and
              computational expense in the evaluation of the cost due to embedded
              quadratures.  Key multidimensional quadrature issues are the unusual integrands
              and regions of integration, e.g., to integrate a function of three variables
              with icosahedral symmetry over the three Euler angles that define a 3-D
              rotation.
