"A Bolometric Array Receiver for
              Measurements of Polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background
              Radiation"
AST-0096778

This program will develop an instrument package to
              detect and characterize the weak polarization signal of the Cosmic Microwave
              Background (CMB) over 100 square degrees at frequencies of 100, 150, and 220
              GHz.  The awardees will construct a bolometer array called QUEST that will
              simultaneously observe 37 pixels on the sky in two orthogonal directions of
              linear polarization.    They will work in collaboration with researchers at
              University of Cardiff, Wales, who will develop a 2.6-meter-diameter telescope
              as the platform for QUEST, to be located at the Mauna Kea Observatory in
              Hawaii.   CMB polarization has not yet been detected, but potentially contains
              much important cosmological information regarding the state of the universe at
              the time of recombination. The  QUEST experiment will enable limits to be set
              on the cosmic inflationary potential that are 3 times more sensitive than
              expected from the space-based Planck Surveyor telescope.
