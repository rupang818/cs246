              This award provides renewed funding to support the Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) program at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) located
              in Woods Hole, MA. The goal of this program is to expose highly selected
              undergraduate interns, recruited nationally, to research in behavior, ecology,
              biogeochemistry, hydrogeology, and management of organisms and ecosystems
              within coastal bays of New England. The work will be done in various field
              sites along the coast of New England, under the direction of experienced
              research mentors. The program will support ten undergraduate interns for a
              total of ten weeks during each summer.  Students will participate in weekly
              workshops focussed on topics such as career options, graduate school,
              statistical analysis, experimental design, and oral and written presentation of
              research. Each student will prepare an oral presentation for the Annual
              Scientific Meeting of the MBL and the reports will be published in the MBL
              Bulletin publication following this event. The proposal is based on the theory
              that mentoring and networking are the most effective methods for recruiting
              students into a profession and for training young researchers. This program is
              well designed to encourage highly motivated students to continue the their
              pursuit of research careers in oceanography. The program will encourage a
              diverse set of students to continue their education in the field of
              oceanography. In the past the program has had more than 50% female participants
              and has drawn students from across the nation.
