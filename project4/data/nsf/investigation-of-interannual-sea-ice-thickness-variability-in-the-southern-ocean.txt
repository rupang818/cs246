The proposed work will develop a systematic climatology of in
              situ antarctic sea ice thickness from observations made since 1980.  Sea ice
              thickness is by far the least well known property - horizontal properties such
              as areal extent and compactness can be observed from satellites - but thickness
              information is necessary to constrain large-scale climate models.  The
              three-dimensional growth and decay of antarctic sea ice is an important feature
              of the global climate system as it directly modifies ocean-atmosphere
              interaction in the Southern Ocean. The four major large-scale sea ice
              properties that need to be monitored for variability and change are ice
              thickness, compactness (including extent), movement, and deformation. 
In
              large-scale climate models, the lack of sea ice thickness data for validation
              introduces a "free"
parameter for arbitrary tuning and allows a wide range of
              results which cannot be checked.  Hence it is difficult to ascertain which
              model physics are correct, leading to divergent viewpoints about the
              sensitivity of the various parameters.
	This project will (1) provide an
              antarctic climatology of in situ sea ice thickness (and secondarily
              compactness) using the recently recovered 11,000 sea ice property records from
              42 voyages between 1980 and 2000;  (2) through validation studies, expand the
              in situ sea ice climatology to include remote sensing
information from U.S.
              National Ice Center ice charts from 1995 to 2000, and (3) contribute to the
              greater knowledge of air-ice-ocean interaction by determining the relationship
              between an antarctic sea ice climatology, climate variability, and climate
              trends.
The work will serve the community at large by linking the sea ice
              climatology results into the public NIC web-site for the validation of
              numerical model outputs, to obtain error-bounded input for data
assimilation,
              to study sea ice processes, and for operational use.
