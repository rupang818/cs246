              Procedural synthesis of natural and contextually appropriate gestures in
              embodied virtual human agents is challenging.  Laban Movement Analysis (LMA)
              offers a descriptive system for human gesture qualities that fills the gap
              between pre-defined gesture playback systems and human animator intuition.  A
              computational analog of LMA called EMOTE has been constructed whose parameters
              modify the performance qualities of arm gesture movements.  EMOTE will be
              developed in several new ways:

* Connect EMOTE with an agent model so that
              an agent's affect, personality, and communicative needs set appropriate EMOTE
              parameters for gesture performance.

* Investigate motion analysis techniques
              for extracting EMOTE parameters from live dual or single camera views.

*
              Experimentally validate the automated acquisition of EMOTE parameters by using
              professional LMA notators for ground truth.

* Use the extracted parameters
              to create instances of parameterized actions which may be subsequently used for
              action, affect, and manner descriptions and, ultimately, for content-directed
              analysis of existing film or video material.

This study will help set
              synthetic agent animation techniques on a sound empirical footing, provide
              evidence that computers can in fact observe important motion qualities, and
              lead to strong connections between internal agent state and external behavior
              qualities.
