              The focus of this research is to develop new synthetic methodology for
              stereoselective [3+2] reactions based on Lewis-acid promoted ylide formation
              for the preparation of complex heterocycles.  The project will focus on
              carbonyl oxides and azomethine ylids produced by conrotatory 4-pi ring opening
              of epoxides and aziridines in the presence of Lewis acidic metals and
              enantiomerically pure ligand systems.  Applications will include the synthesis
              of non-racemic mixtures of diols and the synthesis of (-)-kainic acid.  The
              focus of the educational effort will be the introduction of team-based learning
              approaches to chemistry.  Dr. Johnson has delineated new approaches for the
              education of advanced organic students at U.N.C.

With this CAREER award, the
              Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and
              educational efforts of Dr. Jeffrey S. Johnson of the Department of Chemistry at
              the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.  Professor Johnson will focus
              his research on the development of new methods for the construction of complex
              molecules that have potential for broader impact in the pharmaceutical
              industry.  This work focuses on obtaining only one enantiomer (chiral isomer)
              of an organic compound where the potential for the formation of two isomers
              exists.  These new methods could have important implications for the design of
              medicinally important compounds.  The educational activity of the award
              revolves around improved ways to teach organic chemistry to undergraduates.
