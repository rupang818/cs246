Dunn

This award supports a three-year collaborative research project
              between Professor Robert Dunn of Hendrix College and Professor Geoffrey Stedman
              of the University of Canterbury in New Zealand.  The project will enable an
              international effort to use the extreme sensitivity and wide dynamic range of
              large ring lasers as geophysical research tools.  Specifically, proposed work
              includes upgrades to the ring laser facility in New Zealand, and subsequent
              measurements of such phenomena as earth tides, the rotational components of
              seismic waves, and length of day variations.  

The collaboration brings
              together the efforts of international laboratories that have complementary
              expertise and research facilities.  The project will enhance the international
              research competence of the several undergraduate students from Hendrix College
              who will participate in the research in New Zealand.
