This award will support American graduate students, middle
              school science teachers, and university faculty to participate in research
              related activities in Japan in connection with NSF's Summer Programs in Japan. 
              The project is led by Professor B.F. Spencer, Department of Civil Engineering,
              University of Notre Dame, in collaboration with Professor Yozo Fujino,
              Department of Civil Engineering, University of Tokyo.  Faculty and students
              selected for the program will participate in workshops and site visits prior to
              participation in the formal NSF Summer Programs.  The workshops and site visits
              will provide broad exposure to natural hazards mitigation research in Japan and
              enable the American participants to establish relationships with Japanese
              researchers and students in their field.   

Japan is a world leader in
              natural hazards mitigation research.  Professor Spencer's project will help
              connect American students and researchers to the most active Japanese
              university, government and corporate laboratories in this field.  It is
              expected that this will have the long-term result of increasing U.S.-Japan
              collaboration, to the benefit of both countries.
