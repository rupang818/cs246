Black holes are responsible for some of the most
              dramatic phenomena seen in the current universe.  Furthermore, the environment
              immediately around a black hole is a naturally occurring laboratory in which
              many exotic physical processes will occur and can be studied. Some of the most
              interesting phenomena are associated with the "twisting" and "dragging" of
              space and time due to the rotation of the black hole.  This project will
              conduct a theoretical exploration of the effect that a spinning black hole will
              have on its astrophysical surroundings.  This is an extremely timely study
              since modern X-ray telescopes are already starting to observe such
              effects.

Theory suggests that magnetic fields will be crucial for the
              phenomena associated with black hole spin.  Guided by past work, Dr. Reynolds
              and his collaborators will split the investigation into three parts.  1)
              Conducting computer simulations of the gaseous flows (including the magnetic
              fields) in the vicinity of a black hole. 2) Employing simplifying assumptions
              and approximations to study the complex behavior of magnetic loops in the
              region very close to the black hole.  3) Computing predictions that can be
              directly tested by current and future observations with the XMM-Newton X-ray
              observatory.
