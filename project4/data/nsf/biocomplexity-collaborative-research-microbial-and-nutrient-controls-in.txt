              ABSTRACT


This project, which is being supported by the Directorate for
              Biological Sciences and by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, will
              fund research on mangrove forests that dominate the world's tropical and
              subtropical coasts, paralleling the geographical distribution of coral reefs.
              Ecological processes here are influenced by inputs from the land, sea, and sky,
              which result in extreme fluctuations of flooding, salinity, temperature, light,
              and nutrient availability. Mangrove-associated organisms have specialized
              physiological and structural adaptations that sustain them in this variable
              environment. Human-caused enrichment is one of the major global threats to
              these coastal ecosystems. Experiments show that nutrients are not uniformly
              distributed among or even within mangrove forests. Soil fertility can switch
              from nitrogen to phosphorus limitation across narrow gradients. This study will
              explore the relationships among physical and chemical factors, nutrients,
              microbes, trees, and elemental cycling on off-shore mangrove islands in
              Belize.

We will examine the  interactions between the environment and
              organisms to determine how changes in nutrient inputs from natural,
              agricultural, or urban sources might alter the delicate balance among these
              ecosystem components. Mathematical models will help us predict the contribution
              complexity makes to the ability of mangrove ecosystems to survive both natural
              and anthropogenic disturbances. The results of the study will help scientists
              understand how to better manage and conserve mangrove ecosystems and will
              contribute to our understanding of biocomplexity in other ecosystems.
