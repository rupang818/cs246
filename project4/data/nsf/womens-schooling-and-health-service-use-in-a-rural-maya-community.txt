              Since 1960, analyses of national censuses and large-scale sample surveys have
              shown  that a woman's school attendance is negatively correlated with her
              fertility and her offspring's mortality even when other socioeconomic factors
              are controlled. One theory about this relationship is that maternal schooling
              is a factor in the "uptake" of maternal and child health services by
              influencing a women's openness to mass means of communication and her
              decontextualized language skills. This postdoctoral fellowship research project
              pursues this insight into the importance of communicative means by examining
              the relative effects of more proximal and culturally accessible health
              services. This research into the schooling-sensitive communicative barriers of
              the health system will be conducted at a well regarded clinic in a rural,
              highland Maya community in Chiapas, Mexico.
