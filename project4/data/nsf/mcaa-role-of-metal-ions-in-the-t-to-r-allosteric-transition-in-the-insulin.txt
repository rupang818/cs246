              This Mid-Career Advancement Award (MCAA) by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
              Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Professor Webe W. Kadima
              at the State University of New York at Oswego to pursue training in NMR
              techniques and data analysis methods used for the determination of protein
              structure.  Dr. Kadima will use high field NMR technology to study the role of
              metal ions, such as Cd(II) and Fe(III), in the T- to R-allosteric transition in
              the insulin hexamer (R6) in solution.

The effects of metal ions on the
              association and conformational equilibrium of insulin complexes with metal ions
              will be investigated and the results applied to understanding the behavior of
              insulin in solution and its regulation and function in vivo.  The PI will
              receive training at nearby institutions in protein structure determination
              methods, which will be brought to SUNY Oswego to enhance her research involving
              undergraduates.
