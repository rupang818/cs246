              Single-particle analysis methods (scanning electron microscopy, SEM, and manual
              transmission electron microscopy, TEM) will be used to study aerosols collected
              during ACE-Asia (Aerosol Characterization Experiment). The primary objectives
              are to provide detailed information about particle compositions, size
              distributions, shapes, and state of mixing. Samples will be collected on board
              the NCAR C-130 aircraft, the R/V Ron Brown, and at the ground site at Cheju
              Island, Korea.
