The main objective of this research is to develop a framework for
              using plant data for the development of a reduced-order nonlinear multistep
              prediction model, capable of predicting a long-term behavior of relevant
              variables on the basis of incoming measurements, in the presence of both
              deterministic and stochastic input changes.  Such a model is an essential
              component of the envisioned computer-based system that performs the integrated
              function of process monitoring, soft sensing, and predictive control.  The PI
              will draw upon the subspace identification paradigm that enables the engineer
              to build a state-space prediction model directly from input-output data. The
              proposed research will address the following topics: (1) extension of linear
              subspace identification to nonlinear stochastic systems, involving the
              development of a nonlinear projection method for the construction of
              state-space models, (2) a comparative evaluation of the nonlinear
              projection-based method against other competing options including the direct
              time-series based design and the internally recurrent neural network based
              design, (3) development of a robust model predictive control method for
              piecewise-linear state-space models, (5) development of  a software package for
              the integrated control scheme, and (6) testing of the developed methods on
              distillation columns and reactors.  The development of a model-based estimator
              and controller is of great industrial importance, particularly for a process in
              which control variables are complex functions of process variables such as
              temperature and composition.
