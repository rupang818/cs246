              Astronomy (11) A planetarium system is being incorporated into an undergraduate
              astronomy curriculum. in addition the project provides a basis for outreach
              programs to local elementary and high schools and the surrounding community.
              Many astronomy topics are difficult to teach because of: (1) slow occurrence of
              phenomena in real time; (2) restriction of the observer to the geocentric
              perspective; (3) restriction of the
observer to a single geographical area;
              (4) lack of a dark nighttime sky in urban or suburban areas; (5) in an outdoor
              laboratory setting, dependence upon weather conditions. The goals of this
              project are to solve the above problems by:
(1) increasing both the level and
              pace of student comprehension in the several critical areas in
the
              undergraduate astronomy curriculum which are notorious for their teaching
              difficulty; 
(2) increasing the speed of student comprehension, increasing the
              efficiency of astronomy
lectures, allowing more classroom time to be devoted
              to other topics; 
(3) providing for activity-based learning experiences, which
              in conjunction with lectures have been shown to increase student performance;
              
(4) promoting scientific inquiry in the classroom and beyond by encouraging
              an appreciation of astronomy and of science in general. 
The planetarium
              system will achieve the above goals by accomplishing the following
              objectives:
(1) clearly illustrate both the actual and apparent motions of the
              Earth, Moon, and Sun, from any vantage point on the Earth or from space, in
              compressed time periods much shorter than actual; 
(2) demonstrate the causes
              of the seasons from those motions; 
(3) demonstrate the causes of the phases
              of the Moon and the causes of Solar and Lunar eclipses from those motions;
              
(4) present the real and apparent motions of all planets in an accelerated
              time frame; 
(5) illustrate the celestial coordinate system used by
              astronomers by projecting it onto the background of stars; 
(6) demonstrate
              the effects of the slow precession of the Earth's axis of rotation in a greatly
              accelerated time frame; 
(7) project the positions of stars and of the
              constellations down to near the human eye limit for a completely dark sky;
              
(8) have the capacity for presenting slide shows, or computer graphics and
              animations; 
(9) provide all of the above experiences in an environment that
              is completely weather-proof;
(10)provide for astronomy general education and
              appreciation outreach programs. These factors are
especially important at the
              college, which resides on the Salt River Pima Maricopa Indian Reservation,
              affording the local reservation residents ready access to the planetarium
              public lectures, as well as participation in the campus astronomy curriculum.
              Uses of the planetarium are being adapted from the literature on using
              planetaria effectively in the teaching of astronomy.
