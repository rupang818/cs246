              Computer Science (31)
Through a collaboration of Grand Valley State University,
              Alma College, and the University of Wisconsin/Oshkosh, this project explores
              the use of the algorithm visualization (AV) tool JHAVE on student understanding
              of computer algorithms. We are refining a suite of existing AV resources, each
              of which consists of a visualization, a text description of the algorithm, and
              questions that are presented to the students as they interactively explore the
              algorithm. We are conducting usability studies of the resources on all campuses
              in order to ensure portability of our results.

We are focusing on evaluation
              of the results of these resources using student surveys, faculty surveys and
              examinations which will allow for cross-institution comparisons. We anticipate
              using a working group format to dissemination and enhance our results.
