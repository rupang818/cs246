              Progressive coding and transmission of images and video


In recent years, we
              have witnessed explosive growth of digital video in communications, medicine,
              education and entertainment. Examples are digital TV, DVD, Internet video, and
              telemedicine. Major driving forces behind such growth have been the striding
              advances made in digital technologies for image/video compression, storage,
              computing, and transmission. 


The objective of this project is to
              integrate the PI's research on image/video compression with his teaching plan.
              The research plan addresses the following three aspects in coding and
              transmission of images and video: coding performance, coding functionality, and
              progressive transmission. A diverse yet focused set of research 
projects are
              proposed with regard to these three areas, linked by a multiresolutional
              wavelet transform thread. The teaching plan takes into account the unique
              position of the University of Hawaii. It focuses on teaching our students both
              technical and interactive skills that enable them to compete with others from
              mainland schools.
