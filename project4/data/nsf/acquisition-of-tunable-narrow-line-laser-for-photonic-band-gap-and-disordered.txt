              This is an instrument acquisition award from the Major Research Instrumentation
              program and the Instrumentation for Materials Research program to the City
              University of New York Queens College. The award will allow CUNY Queens College
              to purchase a Coherent 899-29 Autoscan II single frequency scanning laser for
              the study of the statistics of optical propagation in random and nearly
              periodic materials and photonic devices. The instrument will allow the
              principal investigators to extend the coherent technique developed in the
              microwave region of the spectrum to visible and infrared frequencies. It will
              allow them to characterize the statistics of transport using statistical
              measures of the transmitted fields and intensity, and to use the variance of
              intensity fluctuations as a sure test of phonon localization free of
              ambiguities arising from absorption of microwave resonance.  Band edge and
              localized modes in cholesteric liquid crystals will be characterized. The
              objective is to clarify the conjunction of lasing and localization and guide
              development of homogeneous cholesteric materials in which ultra-low lasing
              threshold will be observed. The instrument will provide students preparing for
              careers in physics with a sound mix of microwave and optical techniques as well
              as exposure to industrial research laboratories engaged in forefront research.
