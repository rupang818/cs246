              EPIC (Eastern Pacific Investigation of Climate processes in the coupled
              ocean-atmosphere system) is an activity of the US CLIVAR Program. EPIC 2001
              consists of four components focussing on (i) intertropical convergence
              zone/warm pool phenomena; (ii) cross-equatorial inflow into the intertropical
              convergence zone; (iii) upper ocean structure and mixing and (iv) an
              exploratory study of boundary layer cloud properties in the southeasterly
              tradewind regime. The field phase of EPIC 2001 is scheduled for a 6-week period
              during the interval Sept 1 to Oct 15, 2001. In addition to the eight awards
              made by ATM, this collaborative research has awards made by NSF/OCE and
              NOAA/OGP.

During the field phase, the PI will add special sensors to an
              existing buoy array to collect atmospheric pressure data at a temporal
              resolution of 10 minutes. He also will conduct preliminary large-eddy
              simulations of the quasi-lagrangian evolution of the planetary boundary layer
              as it is advected across the equatorial cold tongue and into the ITCZ. A
              combination of in-situ soundings from past studies and September climatology
              from the NCEP reanalysis will be used to initialize and force these
              simulations. The work is important because it will improve understanding and
              modeling of climate variability over the eastern tropical Pacific.
