              This proposal outlines three lines of work to build evaluation capacity. The
              first line of work involves applying the techniques of  "principled discovery"
              to determine the complexities of contingent intervention effects using selected
              EHR/STEM data sets. The second line of work is the design of a strategy for
              evaluation portfolio management. The expected result is a guide for the
              allocation of evaluation resources to different types of evaluation studies.
              The third line of work is the development and institutionalization of effective
              ways to report and disseminate key evaluation findings to the press at AEA
              meetings. Collectively these three activities should contribute not only to
              evaluation capacity, but also to research and evaluation in general.
