              Summary:  This ESH award will attempt to estimate past concentration of
              carbonate ion in the ocean during glacial/interglacial climate transitions by
              examining the occurrence and magnitude of changes in sediment carbonate
              preservation.  Carbonate concentration will be estimated by two methods:  
              mass/size ratio of planktic foraminifera and the ratio of sand-sized to total
              calcite, in depth transects of cores from the eastern and western tropical
              Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans.
