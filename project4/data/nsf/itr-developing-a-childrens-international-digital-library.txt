              The research program will develop a large-scale digital archive of children's
              literature and explore problems in technology for access and use by children,
              and in rights management.  There are five primary
goals: (1) to give children
              around the world access to international children's literature, (2) to
              understand data acquisition and rights management in the creation of a
              large-scale digital library, (3) to develop interface technologies that support
              children using large amounts of digital information, (4) to evaluate the impact
              of such a collection on children's librariesa and children's librarians, (5) to
              evaluate the impact and benefits of such a collection for children.  The
              project plans to develop a digital library of 10,000 children's books
              representing 100 cultures.
