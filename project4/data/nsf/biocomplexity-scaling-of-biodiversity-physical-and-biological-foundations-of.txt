	Underlying the diversity of life and the complexity of ecology
              is order that reflects the operation of fundamental physical and biological
              processes.  Scaling relationships are emergent quantitative features of
              biodiversity. Some of them appear to be universal, occurring in virtually all
              taxa of organisms and kinds of environments. They are patterns of structure or
              dynamics that are self-similar or fractal-like over many orders of magnitude.
              They can be described mathematically by power functions. They allow
              extrapolation and prediction over a wide range of scales., They offer clues to
              underlying mechanisms that powerfully constrain biodiversity. This research
              will use the interplay of mathematical models and empirical measurements to
              elucidate the physical and biological principles that determine how the life
              history, abundance, distribution, and species richness of organisms scale with
              body size, space, and time. The program of research and education activities
              involves: (1) collaborations among physicists, mathematicians,
              geologists/hydrologists, biologists and ecologists, (2) interactions among
              scientists from seven institutions, (3) cooperation between the University of
              New Mexico, the Santa Fe Institute, and Los Alamos National Laboratory, and (4)
              interdisciplinary training for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.
