	This grant provides operating funds for the relativistic
              
heavy-ion group at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the
              
University of Rochester.  During the three years covered by this grant we
              will complete the analysis of the data collected by E917 at the AGS and start
              taking data using the PHOBOS detector at RHIC.
	PHOBOS is one of the four
              approved experiments ready to run at the turn-on of RHIC.  PHOBOS will have the
              first look at the extreme energy densities that will be created when gold
              nuclei collide at RHIC.  It is believed that a new state of matter, the
              so-called quark-gluon plasma (QGP), will be formed in these collisions.  PHOBOS
              will study this new state of matter, and its properties will provide important
              and new information about the state of the very early universe (a few
              microseconds after the Big Bang).  PHOBOS is designed to study as many
              collisions as possible, in an unbiased way, and to search for significant
              differences between p-p, p-A, and A-A collisions.  Due to its inherent
              simplicity, PHOBOS has the potential of a major scientific discovery during the
              initial running period of RHIC.  The time-of-flight array designed and
              constructed by the Rochester group will significantly enhance the physics
              capabilities of PHOBOS, by roughly doubling its acceptance.
