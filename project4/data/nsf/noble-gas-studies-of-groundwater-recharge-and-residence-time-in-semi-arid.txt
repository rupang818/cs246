In this proposal, we will conduct a noble gas study of a
              series of groundwaters from three well-studied semi-arid regions.  The aims are
              twofold:  first, we plan to assess the potential of the 4He accumulation method
              to accurately estimate groundwater residence times over a range of ages from
              100s to >500,000 years.  The approach will involve inter-calibration with a
              number of different groundwater dating techniques (tritium, 14C and 36Cl, and
              integration of the total database into previouslydeveloped groundwater flow
              models for the individual basins.  An important feature will be ascertaining
              the nature of the 'crustal He flux' and its quantification in the three studied
              areas, particularly as one, the West Mojave River Basin, is situated on
              tectonically active crust while the other two, Central Australia and Botswanna,
              lie on stable cratonic platforms.  We will concentrate on deriving long-term,
              paleo-recharge rates for the three regions-a parameter of vital importance to
              current resource management strategies-but other hydraulic quantities (e.g.,
              aquifer permeability can be also assessed using the 4He technique.

The
              second aim is to utilize the noble gas abundances (concentrations of Ne, Ar, Kr
              and Xe) to derive both temperatures and environmental conditions at the time of
              recharge.  In each of the studied areas, we will select waters, dated by 4He
              and other techniques, to focus on the last glacial period.  Through the
              relationship between noble gases and stable isotopes  d18O and d2H, we plan to
              determine (paleo) temperature variations and other localized effects (e.g.,
              rising water tables) characteristic of past recharge regions.

Through
              collaboration with colleagues from the Geological Surveys of the respective
              regions (U.S., Australia and Botswanna), we will have unprecedented access to a
              wide range of geochemical and geophysical data on the regions of study,
              logistical support for new sample collection, training opportunities on
              state-of-the-art groundwater software, and localized expertise on real-world
              resource and groundwater management issues.
