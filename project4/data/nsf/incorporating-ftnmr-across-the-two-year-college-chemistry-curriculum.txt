Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is an indispensable tool for
              the determination of the structures of molecules, the analysis of chemical
              mixtures, and the determination of reaction kinetics. Efforts to provide
              students with hands-on experience using NMR in the laboratory are greatly aided
              by converting an outdated Varian EM360 continuous-wave NMR spectrometer into a
              modern multinuclear Fourier-transform instrument (FTNMR). This cost-effective,
              user-friendly solution allows rapid data acquisition, making student collection
              of spectra a routine procedure. Adaptation of experiments from the Journal of
              Chemical Education and incorporation of FTNMR into current experiments allow
              students at all stages of their chemical education to have access to the
              instrument. FTNMR is used across the curriculum to demonstrate the power of the
              technique in Introductory Chemistry, to determine molecular structure in
              General Chemistry, and to perform multinuclear and two- dimensional experiments
              in Organic Chemistry. Early and continued exposure to FTNMR reinforces
              important chemical concepts, engages students, helps develop their
              problem-solving skills, and exposes them to the uses of technology in
              chemistry.
