              Improved understanding of the interaction of radiation with cold atomic vapors
              and BEC's will be sought, using nonlinear spectroscopy (both continuous wave
              and pulsed).  In cw spectroscopy collisional effects in cold vapors and mean
              field shifts and scattering in BECs will be studied as a function of the
              frequency difference between two fields.  The spectrum of recoil-induced
              resonances will be calculated.  For pulsed field interactions both the impulse
              and Bragg scattering limits will be studied.
