ABSTRACT



The
              Department of Mathematics at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
              will purchase a cluster
of 16 dual processor PCs connected by gigabit
              network
connections. The computer equipment will be dedicated
as a powerful
              distributed computing resource to the
support of research in the mathematical
              sciences. In
particular, it will support the project Computational
Aspects of
              Secure Cryptosystems.

Public-key cryptosystems occur in applications such
              as
digital signatures, message encryption, user authentication,
online
              payments, and others. The equipment provides an
adequate and up-to-date
              testing environment for
implementing cryptosystems and for simulating
              attacks.
