              in Austin, Texas. 
Its goal is to prepare middle school girls for and support
              their completion of Algebra 1 
in the eighth grade as a means of readying them
              for college preparatory math and science 
classes in high school that lead
              ultimately to completion of the college majors required
for SMET careers. The
              primary objectives of the initial 36-month demonstration period 
include
              improving girls self confidence and academic self-esteem; increasing
              girls'
awareness of SMET careers and the high school and college coursework
              required to enter 
such careers; enhancing girls knowledge of and ability to
              use algebra in their lives; 
improving parents awareness of SMET careers for
              women; and increasing parents'
awareness of ways to encourage their daughters'
              success in algebra and
subsequent math and science courses in high school and
              beyond.

The proposed intervention methods to achieve these ends include
              participation in an
integrated continuum of activities as part of a
              ifgirls-only science math clublc over 
a three-year period, as well as
              involvement in a range of other community- and 
Internet-based math and
              science experiences with parents and other adults. The 
intellectual merit of
              this project derives from its translation of a significant 
portion of the
              body of previous research on the best practices for addressing
              gender
inequities in SMET careers and the disparity in the mathematics and
              science 
achievement of girls in the United States into a single, cohesive
              informal program 
approach. Moreover, the project will employ a cohort design
              that will facilitate an
understanding of what parts of the intervention model
              have the most impact on the
intended outcomes. A rigorous evaluation component
              and a strong dissemination plan 
further strengthen the likelihood that Aiming
              for Algebra will result in a better 
understanding of how specific
              programmatic activities affect girls mathematical 
skills and their attitudes
              about and aspirations for math and science careers.
The straightforward,
              unwavering focus on the completion of Algebra 1 in the eighth
 grade is
              another feature
that makes this project meritorious. By tying its success to a
              single, observable goal
and directing all of its energies to achieve this one
              purpose, the project sets itself
up for rigorous comparison with other efforts
              with an identical goal. Aiming for Algebra 
intends to make its methodologies
              so transparent and so well documented that future 
research and demonstration
              projects can be erected squarely on the intellectual
capital it creates and
              disseminates. Insofar as its broader impacts, the project will
contribute to
              an improved understanding of the ways girls can be best prepared for 
taking
              and making good grades in Algebra 1 before they reach high school; it
              will
advance understanding among teachers and teacher preparation programs of
              how girls' 
expectations of their science and math performance in high school
              and beyond can be 
improved; it will provide empirical evidence of ways that
              female members of groups
underrepresented in SMET careers- including but
              notlimited to those who are ethnic 
and racial minorities, low-income,
              linguistic minorities, and differently abled- can
be included in informal
              programming designed to redress the inequity; and, perhaps most
importantly,
              the project will benefit society by improving the nation's ability to
              
identify and remedy long-standing social, economic and academic practices
              that have
disadvantaged its female population and created obstacles to their
              full and equal 
participation in scientific, mathematical, engineering and
              technological professions.
