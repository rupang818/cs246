              Development Environment for Complex Heterogeneous Distributed Real-Time
              Embedded Computing Platforms

This proposal, describes a number of
              coordinated strategies that will develop to ensure robust and automatic
              composition of ( DRE) distributed real-time and embedded systems, based on
              advances in architectural and resource descriptions that enable concurrent
              exploration.  The DRE applications to be explored in this work are
              representative of a range of real world distributed computing scenarios form
              Grids to microelectronic systems-on-chip (SOCs).  SOC-based computing resources
              incorporating diverse sensing and substantial processing capabilities are
              useful in many DRE application domains, such as avionics, biomedical computing
              resources and tele-medicine, remote sensing, space exploration, and command and
              control systems.  Examples of domains that could benefit from these advances
              include: automated transportation systems distance learning, tele-medicine,
              analysis for combat situations, video conferencing, virtual reality simulation,
              and weather forecasting and analyses.

The core of our proposal focuses on
              coordinated compile-time and runtime strategies that enable simultaneous and
              integrated optimization of (1) DRE application and middleware software and (2)
              the underlying hardware platform consisting of distributed high-performance
              processing elements and customized memory systems.
