              The conference is designed to provide a forum for 
specialists in Dynamical
              Systems and bordering disciplines 
to meet, exchange ideas and present their
              research. The 
field of Dynamical Systems is acquiring increasing
              importance
because of the connections to other disciplines. Some of these
              connections
have been developed over the past, and there are new applications
              that are
constantly found. Traditionally Dynamics has been related
              to
Analysis, Geometry, Number Theory, Differential Equations.
More recent
              applications are found in molecular biology,
population dynamics, theory of
              communications and economical sciences.
Some examples include such
              recently
established and still emerging directions of influence as
              nonlinearity, 
chaos, complexity, information flow, internet and self-similar
              data traffic.

The conference continues the tradition of the Southwest
              Dynamics meetings
of which it will be the fourth Southwest Dynamics
              Workshop.
The previous three conferences took place in
Austin (U. of Texas,
              1994),  Tucson (U. of Arizona, 1996) and
Denton (U. of North Texas, 1997)
              respectively. The meeting will take
place on the main campus of the University
              of Southern California
on 17--19 November 2000. There will be several 1 hour
              plenary talks
and a larger number of more technical 30 minute talks. 
Most of
              the participants will come from the Southwest and 
Northern Mexico and will
              include a considerable number of 
postdocs and graduate students in dynamics
              an adjacent scientific
areas.
