This project is in partnership
              between the ERC for Biofilm Engineering (CBE) at Montana State University and
              ERC for Engineered Biomaterials (UWEB) at the University of Washington. The
              objective is to investigate the potential of prevention and destruction of
              biofilm colonization on medical devices by controlled release of an antibiotic
              from a specially prepared plastic coating. The rate and kinetics of controlled
              release of the antibiotic or other biofilm destroying agent will be
              investigated in CBE's Biofilm Behavior Laboratory (BBL) and Prokaryotic Cell
              Imaging Facility. Research on biomaterials and coatings will be performed at
              UWEB. Graduate and undergraduate students will be exchanged.
