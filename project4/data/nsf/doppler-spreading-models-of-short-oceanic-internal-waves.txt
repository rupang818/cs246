              A numerical modeling study of short internal waves and their approach to
              dissipation (through breaking) and mixing in the presence of longer waves is
              proposed.  Important processes, which will be studied, include:  refraction by
              steady shear, refraction by the vertical divergence of the background flows,
              interactions amongst short waves, phase-group interactions, ray
              convergence/divergence, and short-wave induced mean flows.  The PIs will
              develop a variety of different numerical codes to attack these problems.  The
              level of intensity with which they approach each problem will be adaptive and
              depend upon ongoing developments within their research program.
