              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project from JBliss
              Imaging Systems will determine feasibility of specialized software that enables
              people with low vision to quickly read and process information from many
              sources, and to write and send information to many locations.   The research
              objective is to combine optical character recognition (OCR), speech synthesis
              and recognition technologies, together with displays based on the latest vision
              research to provide an integrated system with a consistent, easy to learn,
              command structure.  Customizable displays are needed to accommodate a variety
              of visual impairments.  The user interface should not require viewing the
              screen, yet it should present visual displays useful to a low vision person and
              be intuitive to fully sighted teachers experienced with graphical user
              interfaces (GUIs).  System functions should include the following: reading
              printed documents; enlarging pictures; writing and word processing documents;
              receiving, reading, and writing e-mail; accessing and interacting with the
              Internet; using an address database; saving and retrieving documents; printing;
              performing calculations; tracking financial accounts; and using a video camera
              for magnification while hand writing and viewing 3D objects.

Commercial
              applications are in schools, libraries, businesses, and homes.  Since
              approximately 5% of individuals over age 15 have difficulty reading newsprint,
              even when wearing corrective lens, the potential market is large.
