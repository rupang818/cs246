This proposal is to study and develop a model of
              international research experience based on the team travel of a graduate
              student, an REU undergraduate student, and a RET teacher participant, to Japan.
               The results of the model study will be used during a subsequent site visit by
              the P.I.'s  for developing international REU/RET sites at national laboratories
              and academic institutions in East Asia.  The institutions being targeted are
              those that have extensively interacted with the P.I.'s during the last ten
              years, in conducting collaborative experiments, as well as via exchange of
              post-docs and faculty sabbaticals.  The purpose of the international research
              experience is to allow the team members to gain an understanding of the
              research culture, as well as the philosophy of baccalaureate and higher
              education in East Asian countries.
