ABSTRACT: 

The successful evolution of the future high-speed
              wireless communication networks requires significant advances in adaptive
              signal processing algorithms that are currently employed for synchronization,
              estimation and equalization of time-varying channels. This research involves
              the development of a general and novel framework for designing robust and
              optimal spectrally efficient channel estimation, synchronization, and
              equalization algorithms. Key elements of the work include development of a
              unified framework for designing and analyzing non-data aided joint carrier
              frequency-offset/Doppler shift and symbol timing estimators in time-selective
              and flat-fading channels, development of a robust non-data aided framework for
              estimation and equalization of time- and frequency-selective fading channels,
              and development of a robust non-data aided space-time signal processing
              framework for synchronization and estimation of multipath signals arriving at
              an antenna array. The proposed research offers a wealth of innovative
              educational projects for course and laboratory instruction.
