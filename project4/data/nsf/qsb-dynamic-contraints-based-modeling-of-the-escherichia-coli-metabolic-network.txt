              The overall goal is to develop quantitative descriptions of bacterial metabolism
              to help elucidate the genotype-phenotype relation. The focus is on augmenting
              network analysis and phenotype prediction by accounting for genetic-level
              capabilities and control mechanisms.  The tasks are to perform a sensitivity
              analysis of a simplified E. coli network model contained using Lagrange
              multipliers from nonlinear programming and to collect data on constraints for a
              large scale dynamic FBA simulation from the literature and existing online
              databases. The union of biochemical engineering and system analysis
              investigators will provide significant cross-training to the student
              involved.
