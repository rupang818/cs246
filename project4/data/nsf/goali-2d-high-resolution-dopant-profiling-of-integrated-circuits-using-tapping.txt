The proposed three-year research collaboration between Lucent
              Technologies and the PI focuses on the further development of a recently
              demonstrated new technique for laterally resolved 2D dopant profiling. This new
              technique uses standard tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TMAFM) with an
              applied direct current (DC) bias between cantilever and sample. Using the TMAFM
              phase signal, bias induced dopant density related variations in Coulomb forces
              are detected, yielding a dopant density map of the investigated
              surface.

Since TMAFM is used to scan the surface, only very weak mechanical
              interaction with the surface occurs resulting in a potentially more stable
              operation than in to date used methods such as scanning capacitance microscopy
              (SCM) or nano-spreading resistance profiling (nano-SRP) where the probe presses
              down on the investigated surface during the measurement resulting in short
              probe life.  While offering the benefits of reproducibility and long probe
              life, the spatial and doping density resolution limits of the TMAFM method are
              potentially similar to the existing methods.

In this context the proposed
              program aims at the further exploration of the basic physical mechanisms of the
              method, finding and optimizing its maximum lateral and dopant density
              resolutions, calibrating it using industry standards and testing its
              application to "real life" industrial state-of-the-art integrated circuit
              samples. In summary, these efforts focus on developing the PI's method into a
              cutting edge metrology tool for integrated circuit research, development and
              production.
