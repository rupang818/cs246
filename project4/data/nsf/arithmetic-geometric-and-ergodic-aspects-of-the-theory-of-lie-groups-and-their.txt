The problems to be investigated are in the area of the
              theory of Lie groups and their discrete subgroups.  One of the main objectives
              is to continue the program of establishing a homogeneous space approach as a
              powerful tool in number theory.   Special attention will be given to the
              problem of "effectivization" in Oppenheim conjecture and its quantitative
              generalizations.  It is also proposed to continue to study recurrence
              properties of random walks on Lie groups and their discrete subgroups on
              homogeneous spaces, manifolds and general metric spaces.

The theory of Lie
              groups and their discrete subgroups is one of the central fields in
              mathematics.  During the last few decades, it was realized that some aspects of
              the theory can be applied to solve certain problems in number theory and
              related topics, which could not be tackled by other methods.  This proposal is
              related to rigidity theory that studies phenomena when rather weak data about
              geometric and mathematical objects determines completely or almost completely
              the structure of those objects.
