              The seafloor contains diverse assemblages of organisms, woven into complex
              ecological systems where their activities, distributions and biological
              interactions are intricately linked to the physical and chemical character of
              the sedimentary environment. It is also an active site of elemental cycling,
              and a critical long?term sink in the global cycles of major constituents,
              including carbon, nitrogen and sulfur. Thus, the interplay between organisms
              and sediment properties can strongly influence the geological/geochemical
              record, clouding the understanding of past climate and paleoceanography, and
              obscuring the ability to determine current rates of elemental cycling and
              burial. There is considerable information about specific processes within
              sedimentary environments but little is known of how to integrate them. Such
              integration is critical to understanding the role of sediments in global
              environmental processes, and the selective pressures affecting population
              structure, community ecology and reproductive success of resident organisms. 
              To understand and predict the interactions between the biology, chemistry and
              physics of sediments, and their impacts on populations, communities, and
              biogeochemical processes, models must be developed to permit the basic
              geochemical and geophysical processes to respond to the activities of
              organisms, and vice versa.

A series of workshops will be held to bring
              together ecologists and ecological modelers, physiologists and microbial
              biologists, physical and geochemical modelers with numerical modeling
              expertise, biogeochemists and applied mathematicians to attack this numerically
              intensive and difficult problem. The goals are as follows: to discuss scales of
              interactions, feedback loops, nonlinear processes and emergent properties, and
              how they might be successfully included in existing modeling approaches; to
              broaden models to achieve integration over multiple spatial and temporal
              scales; to discuss novel mathematical approaches or combinations of models; to
              summarize findings in a commentary piece, and finally to discuss 'next steps'. 
              The research topic will most likely lend itself to one or more research
              proposals, or perhaps, a new initiative in coastal sedimentary processes.
