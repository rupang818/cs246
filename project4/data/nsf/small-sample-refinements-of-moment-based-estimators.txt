              Moment based estimators such as Generalized Method of Moment estimators (GMM)
              are routinely used in estimation of economic models. This project analyzes the
              small sample properties of such estimators. Approximate formulas for small
              sample bias and variance are sued to evaluate different estimation methods.
              Bias corrections based on these formulas are obtained to improve the small
              sample behavior of existing procedures.

Typically, economic models imply an
              infinite number of moment conditions. A selection rule has to be adopted to
              decide which moments to match. An early literature on efficient GMM estimation
              established that in prinicple all available moments should be matched
              asymptotically in order to achieve the most efficient use of the information
              contained in the data. More recent research on the other hand, has found that
              inclusion of more and more moment conditions usually is associated with bad
              small sample performance.

The research will include extensive simulation
              experiments that will shed light on the quality of higher order approximations
              and the performance of different refinements in small samples. Ultimately this
              line of research is intended to give applied researchers guidance in choosing
              the most appropriate statistical tools for a given modeling situation.
