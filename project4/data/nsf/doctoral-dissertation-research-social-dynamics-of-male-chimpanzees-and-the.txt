              This study will investigate how the need for coalition formation during
              within-group and between-group competition shapes social bonds among male
              chimpanzees.  The question will be addressed by testing predictions of grooming
              models originally proposed to study the connection between coalition formation
              and female bonds in primates.  Because male chimpanzees are similar to many
              female primates in using coalitions for competition within and between groups
              and in sharing access to limited resources, application of the grooming models
              will illuminate the role of the two forms of competition in shaping male bonds.
              This study is important because it will enhance knowledge about how competitive
              pressures shape social relationships among male chimpanzees and among male
              primates in general. Furthermore, because chimpanzees are so closely related to
              humans, they are an important referential model for reconstructing hominid
              behavior.  Results of this study will provide insight into the evolution of
              coalitions and competition and their influence on male bonding in humans.  The
              habituated Kanyawara community of chimpanzees at the Kibale Forest National
              Park, Uganda will be studied.  In order to determine the distribution of male
              bonds, continuous social data will be collected during 30-minute focal animal
              follows of the 3 sub-adult and 10 adult males.  Ad libitum data on all
              occurrences of grooming involving adult or sub-adult males will supplement the
              focal data.  In the event of important, but relatively rare events, such as
              coalitions and intergroup encounters, focal samples will be abandoned in order
              to collect detailed ad libitum data on these events.
