This project will determine the role played by low-latitude
              boundary 
currents in seasonal to decadal variability of the tropical Pacific.
               
First, historical observational and model data will be analyzed to 
obtain
              descriptions of the mean and varying structure of the upper and
              
intermediate-depth circulation in the tropical western Pacific.  From
              
these, the oceanic processes involved in seasonal to decadal variability 
of
              the region will be diagnosed and hypotheses about dynamical role of
              
low-latitude western boundary currents will be developed.  Ideas about
              
low-latitude western boundary current dynamics will be tested with
              
numerical models of the tropical Pacific.
