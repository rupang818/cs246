              The project will construct a Virtual Variorum Edition (VVE) of Cervantes'
              (1547-1616) influential "Don Quixote de la Mancha".  The VVE, based on
              available-quality microfilmed images of the original editions published during
              Cervantes' life, will contain the important editions of the work in image and
              text; annotation of the variances present among the editions to enable
              comparison; derivative editions, generated as the result of scholarly analysis
              of the variances and bearing supporting reasoning; and commentary by experts
              that illuminates elements of texts and of the comparisons among editions.  The
              project's focus is on the digital representation, interlinking, and
              dissemination of the many computer-based manifestations of the documents and
              commentary.  It will prototype an end-to-end effort; from front-end acquisition
              of materials through flexible back-end presentation to readers.  The VVE, even
              in prototype form, will be an important artifact, with potential to become the
              standard research tool used by Cervantes scholars.  It will, for the first
              time, make the resource of multiple rare editions of the "Quixote" easily
              available in primary-source form.  The project will have implications for
              Digital Library projects involving the humanities, both as an demonstration of
              what can be achieved today but also through development and validation of
              techniques.
