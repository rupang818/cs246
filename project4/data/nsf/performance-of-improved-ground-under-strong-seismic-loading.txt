Liquefaction-induced foundation displacement during earthquakes
              is a major cause of damage to all types of structures.  However, evidence from
              historical events show that improved sites suffer less ground deformation and
              subsidence than adjacent, unimproved areas.  However, as earthquake-engineering
              moves in the direction of performance based design, the ability to adequately
              and accurately predict the performance of the foundation elements, including
              improved ground becomes paramount.

The ultimate objective of this research
              project is to develop a suite of empirical, experimental, and analytical data
              on the parameters that control seismically induced deformations of improved
              ground to serve as a rational basis for performance based design.  A 2-year
              program of research incorporating 8 centrifuge experiments at UC Davis National
              Geotechnical Centrifuge will be conducted.  This program of experimental work
              is aimed at providing some of the much-needed high quality quantitative
              experimental data.  However, since similar work aimed specifically at marine
              structure and embankments is currently being planned at the Public Works
              Research Institute (PWRI) and Port and Harbour Research Institute (PHRI) in
              Japan, there exists a unique opportunity to integrate the parallel studies and
              obtain the benefits of comparing and evaluating several independent data sets.
