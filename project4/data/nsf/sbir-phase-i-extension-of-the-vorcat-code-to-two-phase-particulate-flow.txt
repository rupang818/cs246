                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop
              innovative, grid-free, numerical models of two-phase, particulate,
              incompressible turbulent flows. The intent is to provide a high fidelity model
              for the simulation and analysis of numerous environmental and industrial flow
              applications wherein particulate motion is a critical feature. Among the
              potential benefits are more accurate and timely predictions of health hazards
              and abatement strategies for the late-time dynamics of toxic particulates or
              contaminant clouds arising from routine, accidental or purposeful chemical and
              biological releases. This   work will be applicable to the dynamics of
              pollutants in the atmosphere, particulate flows in liquids, two-phase turbulent
              mixing and particulate dispersion, among others. 
     This revolutionary
              technology will expand its potential computational fluid dynamics (CFD) market
              share by extending its capabilities to treat complex flows which are of great
              importance to including: aircraft manufacturing, automobile manufacturing and
              power generation.
