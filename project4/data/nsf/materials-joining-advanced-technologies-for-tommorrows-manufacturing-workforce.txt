              
The Portland Community College "Materials-Joining: Advanced Technologies for
              Tomorrow's Manufacturing Workforce" project is an innovative means to prepare
              two-year technology and high schools students and their faculty for the more
              sophisticated and highly automated workplace environments of the near future.
              Specifically, the intent is to expose community college and high school
              students to advanced concepts in metals joining technology by integrating the
              newest joining processes in manufacturing with classroom studies in
              mathematics, physics, materials science, and computer science. To achieve this
              goal, several new courses are being developed, to be capped by a laboratory
              experience entitled "Advances in Joining Science." This capstone experience is
              familiarizing students with fundamental metal joining principles and practices.
              The project employs a flexible delivery system, with emphasis on contextualized
              learning. A hands-on approach to investigating new technology with a concrete
              science platform is thus being offered students as a unique way of exploring
              re-engineering concepts.
