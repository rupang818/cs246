              Modern distributed applications have sparked a growth of interest in
              "publish-subscribe" technologies, where the flow of information is determined
              by interest on the part of the receiver rather than by explicit addressing.
              While its rich communication model and dynamic addressing show great potential
              as a platform for selective information dissemination, the security aspects of
              publish-subscribe are not well understood. This work proposes to research and
              develop a security architecture for publish-subscribe systems, particularly to
              minimize the degree to which the publish-subscribe infrastructure must be
              trusted.  The proposed research will also address the impact of security on
              system scalability, a typical goal of pub-sub systems. In addition to the
              design of a security architecture, this research will include a foundational
              characterization of security goals for such systems and simulations of security
              architectures that result from this study.
