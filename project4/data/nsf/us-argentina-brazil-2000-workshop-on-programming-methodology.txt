This U.S.-Argentina proposal will give support to Dr.
              Natarajan Shankar of SRI International for the organization of a workshop on
              Programming Methodology, to be held in conjunction with the 29th Argentine
              Meeting on Computer Science and Operational Research, to be held in Argentina. 
              The co-organizers are Professor Armando Haeberer of Pontifical Catholic
              University of Brazil, Professor Gabriel Baum of the University of La Plata,
              Argentina and Professor Rafael Lins of the Federal University of Recife,
              Brazil.
Following the two-day workshop, there will be an eight-day school
              directed at young researchers in Argentina and Brazil.  The Argentine Society
              for Informatics and Operations Research is sponsoring these events.  The
              subject of the workshop and school is Program Design Using Logic.  It will
              cover the spectrum of programming methodology including a basic background in
              calculational logic, requirements modeling, refinement calculi, and logics for
              imperative programs.  Correct computer programming is critical to ensure that
              computer software is reliable.  This impacts every aspect of daily life,
              including commerce, communications, power and transportation.

A strong U.S.
              presence at this workshop will help create strong ties and promote lasting
              collaborations with researchers in South America.
