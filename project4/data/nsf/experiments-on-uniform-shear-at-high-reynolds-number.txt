Turbulence theory, in which formal
              relationships between statistical properties of the velocity field are
              developed, undergird the development of the models and computational approaches
              which are the bases for most computational fluid dynamics. The latter is of
              considerable and growing value in fluids engineering. In this investigation,
              the PI will extend his earlier successful efforts to contribute fundamental-
              experimental observations that clarify and refine the basis for new theories.
              He will, in this work, examine very large turbulence Reynolds numbers and his
              data will further clarify issues related to the fundamentally important issue
              of local isotropy. It can be noted that ever larger R-values are to basic
              turbulence research as ever higher beam energies are to particle physics.
