              This dissertation enhancement grant will support Ana C. Carnaval under the
              direction of Dr. John M. Bates of the University of Chicago, for a detailed
              study of phylogeography and population genetics of two species of forest frogs
              in northeastern Brazil. Thirteen populations of tree frog and ten of the litter
              frog will be compared for the effects of geographic distance, fragment age, and
              size on local levels of genetic diversity.  The main goal of these studies is
              to assess the impact of natural and human-made forest fragmentation on the
              population genetics of these species, by assessing levels of mitochondrial and
              nuclear DNA polymorphisms.  

These frog species being examined inhabit
              fragments of Atlantic rainforest, an important vegetational type that may be
              more endangered than the familiar Amazonian forest.  The study will elucidate
              patterns of genetic diversity in Brazilian forests, and the research has the
              potential to shed light on the history of this region and inform local
              conservation practices.  The results likely will have relevance to conservation
              biology, population genetics, and systematic biology.
