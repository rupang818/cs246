We will reconstruct the
              thickness, extent, and subglacial environment of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet
              (SIS) from ~32 ka to ~10 ka.  Four still controversial aspects will be
              considered in the study:  First, what was the thickness of the ice sheet at the
              last glacial maximum (LGM), and did ice-free regions exist in western Norway? 
              Second, is it physically reasonable to interpret geomorphic evidence from the
              central parts of the ice sheet as indicating a cold-based ice sheet through
              most of glacial time?  Third, what was the extent of the eastern margin of the
              ice sheet in Russia at 21 ka - a time for which no geomorphic evidence exists,
              but a key time in GCM simulations of past climates.  Fourth, what were the
              relative contributions of climate and internal cycles to regulating ice
              dynamics, and what was the role of the SIS in a global context?
To answer
              these questions, we will focus our efforts on two key regions of the SIS
              (western Norway, and a transect from northern Norway eastwards into Russia)
              where we will collect samples for preconsolidation tests and cosmogenic dating.
               The results from field work as well as other available geologic and climate
              data will be incorporated into a two-dimensional, time-dependent flowband
              ice-sheet model.
