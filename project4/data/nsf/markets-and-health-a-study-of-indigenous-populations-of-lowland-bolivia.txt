              Abstract 0078801

This project will investigate how market integration affects
              general health and nutrition among three indigenous, Amerindian groups - the
              Moje-o, Chiquitano, and Tsimane' of the Bolivian lowlands. There is presently
              little agreement among scholars concerning whether or not market integration
              (and its presumed "positive" effects on those integrated) actually leads to
              enhanced well being (in this case measured in terms of health). This project
              will contribute to that theoretical debate. The researchers hypothesize that
              markets will allow people to gain access to a broader range of insurance (e.g.,
              credit) and reduce variance in consumption; it is anticipated that lower
              variance in consumption will be associated with enhanced objective measures of
              health/ nutritional status, but increased self-reported morbidity. This
              comparative (cross-cultural) study will examine a range of interacting factors
              including market-related processes, wealth differences, medical access issues
              and objective and self-perceived measures of health. It will contribute to our
              understanding of the material, cultural, and biological drivers of
              health/nutritional status, as  well as to health policy and planning debates
              for parts of the developing world becoming integrated into regional market
              economies.
