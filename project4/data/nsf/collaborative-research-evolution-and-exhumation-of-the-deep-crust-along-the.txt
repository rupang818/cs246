The presence of high-pressure rocks at the
              surface implies considerable crustal-scale tectonism, however the processes by
              which this occurs during the evolution of a continental shield is not well
              understood.  This project will examine the Snowbird tectonic zone of the
              western Canadian Shield to test two models for the age and tectonic scenario
              responsible.  The work also involves application and refinement of a new
              electron microproble age mapping and dating technique that may prove to be
              widely applicable to studies of lower crustal rocks and metamorphosed rocks in
              general.
