Understanding the biology of small migratory animals is
              hampered by the difficulties involved in tracking individuals and integrating
              ecological impacts year-round. The work proposed here addresses seasonal
              linkages in two migratory bird species.  This study will test the hypothesis
              that reproductive success depends on habitat quality occupied in the prior
              tropical winter period in contrast to the conventional alternative that
              breeding conditions alone matter. Winter habitat signatures will be identified
              in breeding birds using stable carbon isotopes sampled in blood tissue. 
              Reproductive success will be measured and assessed according to winter habitat
              occupancy patterns and to indices of breeding territory quality and individual
              condition.  Food manipulations in winter will assess the mechanisms linking
              habitat quality in winter to breeding events.

The abundance and diversity of
              migratory birds comprise a spectacular natural phenomenon.  Such species
              control insect pests, modify plant communities via seed dispersal and
              pollination, and stabilize ecosystems upon which humans depend.  This research
              will contribute fundamental new insights into how the abundance of migratory
              birds is limited and regulated year-round, thereby helping structure seasonally
              linked population models more accurately.  Population models are crucial to
              understand these animals' responses to human impacts on global habitat
              quantity, quality, and climate change.
