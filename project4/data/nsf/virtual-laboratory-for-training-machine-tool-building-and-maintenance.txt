              
This project is developing and testing a virtual laboratory via the Internet
              to enhance the comprehension of the interdisciplinary nature of machine tool
              building and maintenance technology, to reduce costs by maximizing the
              adaptiveness of the curriculum, to enhance learning efficiency in a multimedia
              and multi-intelligence approach (Gardner,1993), and to improve laboratory
              safety with minimized environmental hazards. A coalition of a two-year college,
              a four-year university, a community-based technology center, professional
              associations, and partners from the multimedia software and machine tool
              industry are working together on the project. The expected outcomes are three
              simulation modules, each targeting a particular aspect of machine tool building
              and maintenance technologies that will supplement and complement the existing
              machine technology curriculum in the nation's two-year associate degree
              programs. 

A comprehensive and independent evaluation is being conducted
              prior to national dissemination via both the Internet and CD-ROM to two-year
              colleges, high schools and other community based training centers throughout
              the nation. Pre- and post-tests are being used to evaluate the effect of the
              proposed multimedia modules on students' attitudes and learning. A diverse
              cohort of two-year college students, including women and minorities, are
              participating in the field tests as control and test groups. 

A national
              workshop is being developed to help faculty members learn how to use the
              modules and to develop "customized" modules for themselves.
