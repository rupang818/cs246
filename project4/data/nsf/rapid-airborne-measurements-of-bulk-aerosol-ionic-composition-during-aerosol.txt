              This project supports rapid airborne measurements of bulk aerosol ionic
              composition during ACE-Asia (Aerosol Characterization Experiment). An automated
              instrument will be deployed on the C-130 research aircraft. The instrument
              consists of a particle-in-liquid sampler coupled to a dual channel ion
              chromatograph (IC) analysis system. The following ions can be measured with a
              sensitivity of about 5 pptv over a sample integration interval and duty cycle
              of about 4 minutes: chloride, nitrate, sulfate, sodium, ammonium, potassium,
              and calcium. Particles are collected directly into a liquid which is injected
              online and continuously into the ion chromatograph.
	The rapid ionic
              concentration measurements will be used to chemically characterize and study
              the evolution of the aerosol plumes advected from Asia. Another objective is to
              quantify the extent to which ionic components contribute to aerosol optical
              properties by synchronizing the airborne chemical and physical measurements.
