              The objective of this proposal is to explore the effectiveness of iron-exchanged
              zeolites as catalysts for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of nitrogen
              oxide (Nox) species.  In preliminary work the PI has found that several
              zeolites including ZSM-5 are much more active than the commercial vanadia
              catalysts currently used in many stationary SCR systems.  Also, these new
              catalysts are more resistant to deactivation by sulfur oxides and water.  A
              series of iron-exchanged zeolites will be prepared using four different
              methods: conventional solution ion-exchange, improved aqueous ion-exchange,
              chemical vapor deposition, and solid-sate ion exchange.  Zeolites with small
              pores and low Si/Al ratios were found to be most effective and will be used in
              this project.  Rare earth cations and oxides will be studies as promoters. 
              Catalysts will be characterized by neutron activation analysis and other
              surface analysis techniques.  Steady-state kinetics and the mechanism for NO
              reduction will be studies in parallel with ammonia oxidation.  Nitrogen oxides
              resulting from combustion remain a major source of air pollution.  This study
              will provide a fundamental understanding of the catalytic reaction mechanism
              for NO reduction by ammonia on Fe-zeolites, leading to the development of
              superior SCR catalysts.
