              In 1997, the National Science Foundation support created the Center for
              Learning
Technologies in Urban Schools (LeTUS); a unique partnership focused
              on improving
opportunities for challenging learning for urban children. LeTUS
              brings together two
urban school districts, Detroit and Chicago, and research
              groups from the University of
Michigan and Northwestern University. This
              partnership has created an infrastructure for
developing and sustaining
              broad-based collaboration among professionals from public
schools and
              university contexts, committed to improving teaching and learning in
              urban
schools. This ABR proposal summarizes LeTUS' four years of
              accomplishments and
charts plans for an additional eighteen months of work.
