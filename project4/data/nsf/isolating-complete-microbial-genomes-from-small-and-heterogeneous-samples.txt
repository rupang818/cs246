              The determination of complete genomic sequences relies upon the ability to
              purify relatively large quantities of cells or DNA. But because the majority of
              microbial species can not be cultivated or live in close association with other
              organisms, it is difficult to obtain large and uncontaminated samples of cells
              sufficient for producing whole genome sequences of these organisms. The aims of
              the proposed research are to develop methods for recovering and purifying DNA
              of sufficient quality and quantity for genomic sequencing from small and/or
              mixed populations of cells. Using a combination of cell and DNA enrichment
              procedures, along with whole genome amplification methods, the ultimate goal of
              this project is to devise conditions that would facilitate the analysis of a
              complete microbial genome from a single cell.
