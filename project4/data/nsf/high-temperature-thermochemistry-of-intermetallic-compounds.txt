This research examines alloys of transition metals and
              lanthanide metals and compounds formed between these metals and the noble
              metals as well as lower melting metals indium and lead. The research includes
              gallium alloys and compounds of gallium with the lanthanide metals. The
              investigation of the noble metal compounds is carried out by direct synthesis
              calorimetry at 1200 degrees C.  The gallium and indium compounds are studied by
              the same technique at 1100 degrees C and the lead compounds at 900 degrees C.
