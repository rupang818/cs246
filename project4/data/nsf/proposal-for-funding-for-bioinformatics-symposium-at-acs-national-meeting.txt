              The Analytical and Surface Chemistry program and the Office of Multidisciplinary
              Activities provides support for the Symposium on Bioinformatics held at the ACS
              National Meeting in San Francisco March 26-31, 2000.  The symposium is
              organized by Dr. Robert Kennedy of the University of Florida for the American
              Chemical Society.  Bioinformatics refers to the use of computer searching and
              modeling to maximize utility of database information.  It is particularly
              relevant to the analytical chemistry community where large volumes of data are
              being generated on protein sequences, signal transduction networks and genomic
              sequences.  This is a significant, emerging area of scientific endeavor.  The
              success of Bioinformatics will help integrate multiple disciplines including
              analytical chemistry, biology, biochemistry, biotechnology and computing.  The
              explosive growth in high throughput analytical measurements has resulted in
              correspondingly large data bases of information.  It is imperative that
              effective means of making correlations and identifications with this data are
              developed.

The purpose of the symposium is to bring together scientists to
              promote an understanding of this emerging field, to promote collaborations and
              chart future directions.  The symposium speakers include members from academia,
              the biotechnology industry, the chemical industry and manufacturers.
