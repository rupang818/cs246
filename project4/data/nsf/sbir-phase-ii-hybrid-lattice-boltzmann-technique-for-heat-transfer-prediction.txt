              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will produce a
              unique computational tool for heat transport prediction in industrial devices
              by hybridizing our Digital Physics technology based on Lattice Boltzmann
              Methods (LBM) for hydrodynamics with efficient partial differential equation
              (PDE) solution for heat transfer. The project will start with the development
              and implementation of a wide range of physical features including variable
              thermodynamic and kinetic molecular properties as well as flow dependent
              turbulent/transitional Prandtl number, followed by introducing algorithms that
              ensure stable, accurate, and noiseless performance of the full-physics LBM/PDE
              algorithm. Upon algorithm optimization and benchmarking, we will focus on full
              thermal studies of industrial devices provided by our commercial customers.
              These beta tests will be followed by Phase III commercialization.
 
The
              hybrid thermal transport prediction tool for development in this Phase II SBIR
              project will open major new commercial markets for our current PowerFLOW
              product, especially at the engineering design level, as well as open important
              new markets for novel technologies in various industrial problems ranging from
              classical macroscopic flows to microscopic flows like those in MEMS devices.
              This new technology should also establish new markets for computer aided
              engineering (CAE), especially in manufacturing industries.
