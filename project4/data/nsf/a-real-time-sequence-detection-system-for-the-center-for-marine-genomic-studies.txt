              
This award supports the purchase of instrumentation needed for genomic DNA
              analysis at the Center for Marine Genomic Studies of the Mount Desert Island
              Biological Laboratory. The two instruments to be purchased are a
              second-generation polymerase chain reaction (PCR) thermal cycler with
              four-channel fluorescence microplate reader that permits monitoring of
              reactions in process, and a robotic microplate processor that allows efficient
              set up of the 96-well plates used in the PCR device. The instruments will
              facilitate studies of the expression and function of genes in marine organisms
              with particular emphasis on improving the understanding of physiological
              processes in relation to environmental determinants such as salinity and
              temperature. Four NSF-funded research projects will make major use of the
              requested instruments.  These focus on molecular studies of membrane transport
              proteins and associated enzymes in the gills of euryhaline teleost fish and of
              crustaceans.
