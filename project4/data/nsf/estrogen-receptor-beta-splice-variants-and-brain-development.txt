              The hippocampus, a part of the mammalian brain involved in cognitive functions,
              is also sensitive to the steroid hormone estrogen.  Estrogen is known to
              influence the sexual differentiation of the hippocampus, but the molecular
              mechanisms for this development are not clear.  Numbers of estrogen receptor
              (ER) molecules in the hippocampus increase during development, triggered by
              transient expression of both the alpha and beta forms of ER, which suggests a
              possible novel critical period for estrogen action.  The transient expression
              of ER-beta is predominantly of an isoform splice variant termed -delta 3 (-d3),
              which acts through a unique molecular mechanism to regulate target genes,
              unlike the classically described estrogen-response element (ERE).  This project
              uses molecular biology to examine the function in vitro of these -d3 splice
              variants of ER-beta.  Transient transfection, reporter gene analysis, and other
              transcription and trafficking assays will determine how -d3 variants drive
              transcription and interact with other regulatory proteins and other ER receptor
              types.  The project also bridges the effects seen in vitro with those normal
              physiological events seen in the living animal.
   Results will clarify a
              novel mechanism of how estrogens affect hippocampal development, and will be
              important beyond neuroendocrinology, on developmental biology and potentially
              on cognitive neuroscience.  The project also involves training undergraduates
              and graduate students in an excellent laboratory research environment.
