The genetic mechanism of plant adaptation to increasing
              elevation, from sea level to 10,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada mountains, will
              be studied using a combination of laboratory and field experiments.  Mimulus
              cardinalis, a plant species adapted to long, hot summers at low elevation, has
              been crossed with Mimulus lewisii, a closely-related species adapted to the
              short, cool growing season found in high-elevation alpine meadows.  More than
              50 years of research has shown that the offspring of crosses between these two
              species differ in their ability to survive and grow at low, middle, and high
              elevations.  This study will use DNA-based genetic maps of the Mimulus
              chromosomes to identify the number of genes controlling survival, growth, and
              reproduction at three historically important field stations (Stanford, Mather,
              and Timberline) in central California.

The gene pools of many closely
              related species are kept separate by the geographic isolation resulting from
              adaptation to different environments.  Adaptation is believed to be the
              principal means by which biological diversity is created and maintained.  The
              pace of adaptive evolution depends upon the number of genes that govern
              adaptive traits such as tolerance of extreme temperatures or number of flowers
              produced during the growing season.  With modern methods of molecular biology
              and genome mapping, it is possible for the first time to estimate the number of
              genes required for organisms to adapt to different natural environments.
