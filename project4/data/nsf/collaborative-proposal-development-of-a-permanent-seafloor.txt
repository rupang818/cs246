              This ocean science technology development project involves the design,
              construction, testing, and installation of a seafloor geomagnetic observatory
              at the Hawaii-2 Observatory (H2O) site located midway between California and
              Hawaii in 5000 m of water. The geomagnetic instrumentation to be installed
              meets INTERMAGNET standards for data accuracy and timing. It will consist of a
              delta Idelta D magnetometer, a gyrocompass for absolute direction measurement,
              a set of suspended magnet variometers, auxiliary environmental sensors, and a
              separate geoelectric observatory utilizing electrode chopping techniques. Power
              will be supplied by H2O and real-time, two-way communications will allow both
              control of the observatory from land and transmission of data to the user. The
              data from this site will be made freely available to the scientific community
              through INTERMAGNET. The geomagnetic observatory will also be a prototype for
              future installations at other sites.
