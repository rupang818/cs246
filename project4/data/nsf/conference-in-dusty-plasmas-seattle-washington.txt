              This award is for participants to attend and deliver lectures at the "Dusty
              Plasma Mini Conference" to be held in conjunction with the American Physical
              Society (APS), Division of Plasma Physics Annual Meeting in Seattle,
              Washington, 14-19 November 1999.  Dusty Plasmas play an important role in the
              aeronomy of the lower ionosphere.  For example, the formation of noctilucent
              clouds and its role in determining the dynamics of the D region is an
              outstanding problem of significant interest.  There are a number of other
              important applications of dusty plasmas as well.  It is a rapidly growing
              interdisciplinary science with a promising future.  The American Physical
              Society will provide funding to key invited speakers, who would otherwise be
              unable to attend the meeting due to lack of funds.  The participation of these
              speakers is necessary to maintain a high quality of scientific content for this
              conference.
