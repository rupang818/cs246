Maxwell

This is a planning visit grant for Professor Lorraine E.
              Maxwell, with the Department of Design and Environmental Analysis at Cornell
              University, to travel to Ghana to participate in a Faculty Development Seminar
              sponsored by the Council on Educational Exchange, which will be held at the
              University of Ghana in Legon.  She will discuss the results of her
              NSF-supported project (SES-9616686) on the long-term effects of residential and
              school crowding on children's cognitive and social development with
              participating Ghanaian faculty members for the purpose of identifying potential
              collaborators for a cross-cultural research project on the topic.
