              The primary topic is the interaction of two-electron atoms with intense laser
              fields, which leads to detachment of the electrons.  An important mechanism is
              recollision, in which one electron is removed from the atom and then oscillates
              in the laser field, recolliding with the residual atom one or more times.  It
              is found that double collisions can be more effective than single collisions in
              removing the remaining electron.  The plan is to use models of the two electron
              atom in analytic and numerical studies of these mechanisms of double
              ionization.  It is also planned to study photorecombination, in which electrons
              recombine with atomic ions in the presence of the intense laser fields. 
              Undergraduate students will contribute to the project in computer programming
              and analysis, but also in explaining the physics of the double-ionization
              process.
